###1.2 Current Situation, Needs, and Ideas:
####1.2.1 Current Situation:
- English language is important to learn, but Pronunciation practice has obstacles:
  > Lack of Immediate Feedback
  > Traditional Class Focusing on Writing & Reading Practice
  > Tutors' high entrance cost
  > App's absence of broad Pronunciation Practice
- Mentioned Issues decrease Students' motivation
- Lacking motivation leads to Inconsistent Practice & Failure

####1.2.2 Needs:
- App focused on English Speech Practice
- Said App Needs to Cultivate Motivation & Learning Discipline

####1.2.3 Ideas:
- "Pronunciation Coach" Project that will Develop a Plataform for English Speech Education
- App allows Speech Practice and Construct Discipline

###1.4 Synopsis:
- English Pronunciation Practice has numerous Obstacles
- Obstacles deter Students' motivation, which deter Practice and Leads to Failure

###1.6 Other Activities:
- Multiple Research on topics that can be Implemented in the "Pronunciation Coach" App as the Domain allows it
- Discuss adjacent topics that allow for a Domain Expansion once Main Objectives are Completed
- Test Various Features to Confirm Efficiency

###1.7 Derived Goals:
- Save a Student's previous Exercises to Determine Scores
- Implement IPA Definitions to Contextualize Information
- Offer Speech Graphs that Determine pronunciation Information

##2. Descriptive Part
###2.1 Domain Description:
####2.1.1 Domain Rough Sketch:
- LEARNING USER represents User with interest of learning English Speech
- PRONUNCIATION EDUCATION APPLICATION is the set of entities, behaviors, functions, etc. such:
  > Educates Users of English Speech
- SPEECH is verbal communication done in the App
  > English subset
- PHONETIC SYMBOLS are the IPA Symbols that represent sounds
  > English subset
- TRANSLATOR is the core function that allows conversion of the following inputs:
  > English words
  > English IPA Symbols
  > Speech audio

####2.1.2 Terminology:
- "Pronunciation Coach" Application:
  > Set of entities, behaviors, functions, etc. such that allow English Speech Education
- Student:
  > User of the App with the Interest of Studying & Learning English Speech
- Speech:
  > Verbal communication done through the App, English subset
- IPA:
  > International Phonetic Alphabet Symbols that represent sound, English subset
- Translator:
  > Functions that allow English words, IPA symbols, or speech to be converted to other symbols

####2.1.3 Domain Terminology VS Rough Sketch:
Format:
- Rough Sketch Definition:
  > Interpretation
  > Terminology

- Learning User:
  > Represents Character with Conversation Education Interest
  > Student
- Pronunciation Education Application:
  > Entities, Behaviors, etc. used to Instruct Conversational English
  > Pronunciation Coach Application
- Speech:
  > Verbal English Communication through App
  > Speech
- Phonetic Symbols:
  > Letters that define English sounds by text
  > IPA
- [...] Translator:
  > Function that Converts between English words/IPA/audio
  > Translator

####2.1.4 Domain Narrative:
- Assume Arbitrary number of Students:
  > Subset1 of Students Request IPA
    * App returns IPA Documentation
    * App returns IPA Pronunciation
  > Subset2 of Students Test Speech:
    * App Translates Speech to Text/Graphs
    * App Determines Pronunciation Accuracy
  > Subset3 of Students Test IPA:
    * App Returns IPA Symbols
    * App Expects Students' Conversion to Text

####2.1.5 Events, Actions, and Behaviors:
- Events:
  > IPA Documentation has been Presented
  > Speech has been Translated to Text
  > Student Speech has been Graphed
- Actions:
  > IPA Definition:
    * Students want IPA Context:
      # IPA Context was Requested
    * Accept Request:
      # Return IPA Documentation
      # IPA Documentation was Presented

####2.1.6 Function Signatures:
- Save Speech:
  > Speech: Audio --> Text --> List<Text>
- Profile Creation:
  > Profile: Email * Password --> User

###2.2 Requirements:
####2.2.1 User Stories, Epics, Features:
- As a forgein Student, I want to be able to know if I'm speaking correctly, so that I can spot my errors & work in fixing them.
- As a begginer Student, I want the IPA symbols' pronunciations so that I can practice English sounds I struggle with.
- As a curious Student, I want to be told my mistakes so that I can work on fixing them.

####2.2.2 Personas:
- Students with strong accent who wants to pronounce American English sounds properly
- Students who struggle in relating to known phonetic in new words:
  > Ex. Knowing "come", but not "become"
- Students who know English, but struggle communicating
- English mayor Students who want to learn the IPA

####2.2.3 Domain Requirements:
- System must store Students' profiles
- System must offer IPA context
- System must foment Activate practice
- System must correct unproper speech
- System must test Students' performance

####2.2.4 Interface Requirements:
- System must scale for any device
- System must display speech activities
- System must show correct profiles
- System must have legible Information
- System must allow account creation

####2.3.5 Machine Requirements:
- System must support 500+ Students
- System must load lessons by 0.5 seconds
- System must retrieve profiles by 0,4 seconds
- System must run on phones or desktops
- System must avoid 10GB+ space consumption

###2.3 Implementation
####2.3.1 Selected Fragment of Implementation:
- [Snippet] Speech to Text Translator: Microphone audio --> Text
  void _listen() async {
    if (!_isHearing) {
      setState(() => _text = "Listening...");
      _speech.listen(
        onResult:(result) {
          setState(() {
            _text = result.recognizedWords;
            _confidence = result.confidence;
          });
        },
      );
      setState(() => _isHearing = true);
    } else {
      _speech.stop();
      setState(() => _isHearing = false,);
      saveResult(_text);
      setState(() => _text = "Press the button and speak");
    }
  } 

##3. Analytic Part:
###3.1 Concept Analysis:
- Student is abstraction of User with Speech interest
- Speech is an abstraction of Conversational English
- IPA is an abstraction for English Symbols of International Phonetic Alphabet
- Translator is an abstract of a function that converts inputs to English words/IPA/audio

###3.2 Validation and Verification:
- Validation will be constant, with higher emphasis by Milestone Stamps
  > Moderators that run quality-control:
    * Professor
    * Managers
    * Team Leaders
    * Team Members
- Verification will run by Developers during Implementations
  > Example of Forms of Verification:
    * Unit Testing
    * Model-Checking
