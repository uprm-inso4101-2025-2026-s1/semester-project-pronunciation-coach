- English language is important to learn, but Pronunciation practice has obstacles:
  > Lack of Immediate Feedback
  > Traditional Class Focusing on Writing & Reading Practice
  > Tutors' high entrance cost
  > App's absence of broad Pronunciation Practice
- Mentioned Issues decrease Students' motivation
- Lacking motivation leads to Inconsistent Practice & Failure

- As a begginer Student, I want the IPA symbols' pronunciations so that I can practice English sounds I struggle with.
- As a curious Student, I want to be told my mistakes so that I can work on fixing them.

####2.2.2 Personas:

      setState(() => _text = "Listening...");
      _speech.listen(
        onResult:(result) {
          setState(() {
            _text = result.recognizedWords;
            _confidence = result.confidence;
          });
        },
      );
      setState(() => _isHearing = true);
    } else {
      _speech.stop();
      setState(() => _isHearing = false,);
      saveResult(_text);
      setState(() => _text = "Press the button and speak");
    }
  } 

##3. Analytic Part:
###3.1 Concept Analysis:
- Student is abstraction of User with Speech interest
- Speech is an abstraction of Conversational English
- IPA is an abstraction for English Symbols of International Phonetic Alphabet
- Translator is an abstract of a function that converts inputs to English words/IPA/audio

###3.2 Validation and Verification:
- Validation will be constant, with higher emphasis by Milestone Stamps
  > Moderators that run quality-control:
    * Professor
    * Managers
    * Team Leaders
    * Team Members
- Verification will run by Developers during Implementations
  > Example of Forms of Verification:
    * Unit Testing
    * Model-Checking

####3.2.1 Validation Scenarios:

- Validation complements verification by confirming that the system being developed 
is the one stakeholders actually want. “Are we doing the right thing?”
- Each scenario below represents a concrete, inspectable situation that a stakeholder 
could review without any technical knowledge.

> Scenario A – Pronunciation Feedback

  - Goal: Allow learners to confirm whether their spoken words are correctly pronounced.
  - Stakeholder Perspective: I want immediate, understandable feedback on pronunciation quality.
  
  - Preconditions:
    > Student is logged into the app.
    > Microphone permission granted.
    > Audio output device available.
  
  - Main Flow:
    > Student chooses to practice their pronunciation.
    > Select the words they want to practice.
    > Press record and pronounce the first word.
    > App analyzes audio -> converts speech to text -> computes pronunciation score.
    > Screen shows pronunciation score and highlighted problematic sounds, as well as feedback.
    > Process repeats until all words have been practiced.
  
  - Edge Cases:
    > Background noise detected 
      -> App pauses and displays “Detecting a lot of background noise,
      please move to a quieter area.”
    > No speech captured 
      -> Prompt to re-record.
    > Spoken input ambiguous (ex. “wood” vs. “would”) 
      -> App pauses and displays “Your pronunciation matches several words. Please confirm which one you meant.” 
      Then shows a small list of candidate words for student to choose. Student selects intended word, 
      program continues. If none match, then student is prompted the option to try again.
                  
  - Observable Outcomes:
    > Score displayed per word.
    > Mispronounced syllables highlighted.
    > Feedback tip (ex. “/æ/ sounds too short”).
  
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    > Given clear input audio, when the learner records a word, 
    the app displays the score and some feedback tips within 2-3 seconds.
    > Given background noise above the defined threshold, when recording starts, 
    the app shows the noisy environment warning and prevents scoring.

> Scenario B – Custom Quiz Practice

  - Goal: Let a learner practice self-chosen words via 4-option 
  IPA questions (with audio for each option), receive immediate correctness feedback, 
  and then speak the word through STT for pronunciation feedback.
  - Stakeholder Perspective: I want to practice my words, hear how each IPA option sounds, 
  choose the right one, and then try saying it to get feedback.

  - Preconditions:
    > Student is logged into the app.
    > Microphone permission granted.
    > Audio output device available.
    > Cached audio present.
  
  - Main Flow:
    > Student selects Quiz -> Custom Practice.
    > App prompts “How many words do you want to practice?” Student enters a number N (ex. 5).
    > App prompts the student to input N words. (ex. software, computer, friend, thought, joy).
    > For each word, the app generates one 4-option question: each option is an IPA rendering of the 
    target word (one correct and three distractors).
    > Student can tap a speaker icon on each option to hear that IPA realized as audio.
    > Student chooses an option -> App shows correct/incorrect with feedback tip(s).
    > After answering all questions, App prompts the student to "say the word" for each practiced word.
    > Student records pronunciation -> App analyzes and shows feedback per-word, 
    which includes the score and feedback tip(s).
    > App displays a results page with: overall quiz score, per-word question results,
    and per-word speaking score. Student can choose to retry or save their results to their profile.
  
  - Edge Cases:
    > User enters a number N ≤ 0 or non-integer: 
      -> App prompts “Please enter a whole number greater or equal to 1”.
    > A typed input word is not recognized (OOV): 
      -> App suggests closest matches or asks the student to replace the word.
    > An audio option fails to play: 
      -> App shows “Playback error” and offers re-fetch. Question can still be answered.
    > A duplicate word is entered: 
      -> App prompts the student to “Please enter a different word”.

  - Observable Outcomes:
    > Running list of all entered words remains visible until quiz starts.
    > A clear progress indicator during the IPA questions and the speaking step.
    > Each item shows 4 options, each with a speaker icon. The selected option is visually marked.
    > Immediate Correct/Incorrect marker plus at least one feedback tip.
    > Final results page with overall % score, per-word IPA question results, and per-word speaking score.
    > If saved, a new history entry appears with timestamp, quiz information, and scores.

  - Acceptance Criteria:
    > Given a number N ≥ 1 and N words entered: when the quiz starts, exactly N items are presented, 
    each with 4 options and audio playback per option.
    > Given a valid item, when the learner taps an option, 
    the App shows Correct/Incorrect and at least one feedback tip within 2-3 seconds.
    > Given the speaking step, when the student records a word, 
    the App returns a pronunciation score percentage and at least one feedback tip within 2-3 seconds.
    > Given a playback error during audio fetch, 
    the App shows “Playback error-Audio unavailable” and still allows a selection.
