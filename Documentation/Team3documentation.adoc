== 2. Descriptive Part

=== 2.1 Domain Description

==== 2.1.1 Domain Rough Sketch

Interview with Maria Gonzalez (ESL student, age 24): "When I practice English pronunciation, I never know if I'm saying words correctly. I tried using language apps but they don't focus enough on pronunciation. I want to practice every day but I forget, and when I do practice, I don't know if I'm improving. Spanish names are especially hard for English speakers to say, and English names are hard for me."

Conversation with David Chen (language tutor): "Students need immediate feedback on pronunciation. They make the same mistakes repeatedly without correction. Daily practice is essential but hard to maintain motivation. Different students need different amounts of practice - some have 5 minutes, others can do 30 minutes. Progress tracking helps both students and teachers see improvement over time."

Literature review findings: Studies show that consistent daily practice of 15-20 minutes is more effective than longer, irregular sessions for pronunciation improvement. Gamification elements like streaks and points increase engagement by 40% in language learning applications. Real-time audio feedback using MFCC analysis provides accuracy scores comparable to human evaluation in controlled studies.

Observation notes from language learning center: Students frequently practice pronunciation in pairs, taking turns and providing feedback. Many students use smartphones for language practice. Visual progress indicators motivate continued effort. Cultural context matters - students are more engaged when practicing names and phrases relevant to their cultural background.

==== 2.1.2 Domain Terminology

**Pronunciation**: The manner in which words and names are spoken, including proper articulation, stress patterns, and phonetic accuracy.

**Language Learner**: An individual acquiring proficiency in a non-native language, specifically focusing on spoken communication skills.

**Native Speaker**: A person who learned a language from birth, providing authentic pronunciation models for language learners.

**Tutor**: A person (teacher, language coach, or peer) who evaluates learner pronunciation and provides corrective feedback.

**Pronunciation Accuracy**: The degree to which a learner's spoken pronunciation matches native speaker patterns, measurable through acoustic analysis.

**Daily Practice**: Regular pronunciation exercises performed consistently each day to build muscle memory and phonetic familiarity.

**Pronunciation Feedback**: Information provided to learners about the correctness of their pronunciation attempts, including specific guidance on improvements.

**Streak**: A consecutive sequence of days during which a learner completes pronunciation practice, serving as a motivation mechanism.

**Learning Pace**: The intensity and duration of daily practice sessions that accommodate individual learner scheduling constraints.

**Pronunciation Challenge**: A specific pronunciation task or word that a learner attempts to master, varying in difficulty based on phonetic complexity.

**Progress Tracking**: The systematic recording and visualization of improvement in pronunciation skills over time.

**Practice Session**: A time-bounded period during which a learner engages in pronunciation exercises.

**Pronunciation Model**: An example of correct pronunciation, typically demonstrated by a native speaker or tutor.

==== 2.1.3 Domain Narrative

Language learners engage in pronunciation practice as part of their broader language acquisition journey. When a learner encounters unfamiliar words or names, they must develop accurate pronunciation patterns through repeated practice and feedback. This process requires consistent daily engagement, as pronunciation skills deteriorate without regular reinforcement.

Native speakers serve as pronunciation models, providing authentic examples of correct pronunciation patterns. Language learners compare their attempts against these models, adjusting their articulation based on perceived differences. However, self-assessment of pronunciation accuracy proves challenging for learners, creating a need for external feedback mechanisms.

Daily practice sessions vary in duration based on individual learner circumstances. Some learners allocate brief 5-minute sessions during commutes, while others dedicate 30-minute focused practice periods. Consistency proves more important than duration, with daily engagement producing better results than sporadic longer sessions.

Pronunciation challenges increase in difficulty as learners progress. Beginning learners focus on individual phonemes and simple words, while advanced learners tackle complex multisyllabic words and culturally specific names. Regional variations add complexity, as learners must choose between different pronunciation standards.

Progress in pronunciation occurs gradually, with learners experiencing periodic plateaus and breakthroughs. Motivation fluctuates based on perceived progress and external encouragement. Learners benefit from visual indicators of improvement and social recognition of achievements.

Cultural context influences pronunciation learning motivation. Learners show increased engagement when practicing names and phrases relevant to their personal or professional environments. Cross-cultural name pronunciation presents particular challenges, as traditional spelling patterns may not correspond to expected pronunciations in the target language.

==== 2.1.4 Domain Entities

**Language Learner**: Individual with specific pronunciation goals, available practice time, current skill level, and motivation patterns.

**Native Speaker**: Person who speaks a language from birth, serving as pronunciation model and reference standard.

**Tutor**: Person who evaluates learner pronunciation attempts and provides corrective feedback and guidance.

**Pronunciation Model**: Audio or live demonstration of correct pronunciation for specific words or phrases.

**Practice Session**: Time-bounded pronunciation practice activity with defined duration and completion criteria.

**Pronunciation Attempt**: Learner's spoken effort to pronounce specific words, subject to evaluation.

**Feedback Response**: Information about pronunciation accuracy provided by tutors, including specific guidance on articulation improvements.

**Daily Streak**: Consecutive sequence of days with completed practice sessions, serving as motivation indicator.

**Learning Progress**: Observable improvement in pronunciation accuracy over time.

==== 2.2.6 Function Signatures and Specifications

- Purpose: Define the required system functions formally, focusing on what they must achieve, not how they are implemented.
- Approach: Each function is described by its signature (inputs and outputs) and its specification (requirement behavior).
- Relation to Domain: While Section 2.1.5 covered domain functions, this section specifies system-level requirements functions.

- System function examples:

| Function             | Signature                                                    | Specification                                                                                                      |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Assess Pronunciation | `AudioRecording → PronunciationModel → AccuracyScore`        | Given a learner's audio input and a reference pronunciation model, return an accuracy score reflecting similarity. |
| Update Streak        | `UserID → Date → StreakStatus`                               | Determine whether the user's streak continues, resets (gap), or starts new.                                        |
| Calculate XP         | `ChallengeCompleted → DifficultyLevel → XPPoints`            | Award XP points based on challenge completion and difficulty rules.                                                |

| Persist Progress     | `UserProgress → StorageStatus`                               | Save the user's progress data and confirm successful persistence.                                                  |

- Classification of the functions:

- Core Learning Functions: assessPronunciation, selectChallenge
- Gamification Functions: updateStreak, calculateXP
- Persistence Functions: persistProgress

==== 2.2.7 Error Handling and Data Validation Requirements

- Purpose: Define how the system should handle unexpected input, errors, or invalid data during pronunciation assessment, progress tracking, or user interactions.

- Approach: The system must ensure robust handling of input errors, storage failures, or invalid states without losing user data or crashing.

- Requirements:

Input Validation
*The system must reject empty or corrupted audio recordings before processing pronunciation.
*The system must validate user identifiers, practice duration inputs, and challenge selections for correct data types and formats.

- Error Feedback
*The system must display meaningful error messages (e.g., "Audio not detected", "Network unavailable") instead of generic error codes.
*All error messages must be localized according to the user's language settings.

- Recovery Behavior
*If data persistence fails, the system must retry saving up to three times before alerting the user.
*On app restart, the system must automatically reload the last saved progress.

- Logging and Debugging
*Critical errors (e.g., file I/O or network failures) must be logged internally for diagnostic purposes.
*Non-critical UI validation issues (e.g., incomplete forms) must be displayed to the user without interrupting their session.

- Relation to Domain:
*Supports the learning continuity principle by preventing data loss and maintaining learner motivation even during minor system errors.

- Classification:
*Core Stability Requirements: Input Validation, Recovery Behavior
*User Experience Requirements: Error Feedback, Localization
*System Maintenance Requirements: Logging and Debugging

=== 2.3 Implementation

==== 2.3.1 Software Architecture

The Pronunciation Coach application follows a layered architecture pattern supporting separation of concerns and maintainable component organization:

**Presentation Layer**: Flutter widgets implementing Material Design patterns for user interface components. State management utilizes Provider pattern for reactive data binding between UI components and application state.

**Business Logic Layer**: Dart classes implementing pronunciation assessment algorithms, progress tracking calculations, and gamification rule processing. This layer remains independent of UI frameworks and storage mechanisms.

**Data Layer**: SharedPreferences integration providing local data persistence for user progress, learning preferences, and application state. Future expansion supports cloud synchronization capabilities.

**Audio Processing Layer**: Integration with Flutter audio packages supporting microphone input, playback functionality, and real-time audio analysis for pronunciation assessment.

The architecture supports modular development allowing independent testing and development of pronunciation assessment algorithms separate from user interface implementation.

==== 2.3.2 Software Component Design

**MyAppState Component**: Implements centralized state management for learning pace selection and persistence. Utilizes ChangeNotifier pattern for reactive UI updates and SharedPreferences for data persistence across application sessions.

```dart
class MyAppState extends ChangeNotifier {
  LearningPace? selectedPace;

  void setPace(LearningPace pace) async {
    selectedPace = pace;
    notifyListeners();
    _savePace(pace);
  }
}
```

**UserProgress Component**: Encapsulates daily streak tracking, XP point management, and progress persistence logic. Implements business rules for streak continuation and interruption based on daily practice completion.

**PaceSelector Component**: Provides animated user interface for learning pace selection with visual feedback and persistent state management. Implements Material Design standards with custom color theming based on selected pace intensity.

**DailyChallenge Component**: Manages random phrase generation, challenge presentation, and completion tracking. Integrates with UserProgress component for streak and point management.

==== 2.3.3 Selected Implementation Fragments

The pace selection persistence mechanism demonstrates integration between UI state management and local storage:

```dart
Future<void> _savePace(LearningPace pace) async {
  final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  prefs.setString("selectedPace", pace.toString());
}

Future<void> _loadPace() async {
  final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  final paceString = prefs.getString("selectedPace");

  if (paceString != null) {
    selectedPace = LearningPace.values.firstWhere(
      (e) => e.toString() == paceString,
      orElse: () => LearningPace.casual,
    );
    notifyListeners();
  }
}
```

This implementation ensures user preferences persist across application sessions while providing fallback defaults for new users.

The daily challenge completion logic demonstrates gamification rule implementation:

```dart
void completeActivity() {
  final today = DateTime.now();
  if (lastActiveDate != null) {
    final difference = today.difference(lastActiveDate!).inDays;
    if (difference == 1) {
      streak++;  // Consecutive day extends streak
    } else if (difference > 1) {
      streak = 1;  // Gap resets streak to current day
    }
  } else {
    streak = 1;  // First completion starts streak
  }
  points += 100;  // Standard XP reward per completion
  lastActiveDate = today;
}
```

=== 2.3.4 Domain Engineering Integration

The backend implementation will align with the principles outlined in the presentation Domain Engineering and Domain Facets. The lecture emphasizes that a system's design should emerge from a structured understanding of the domain model, its facets, and the stakeholders who interact within it.

Following this approach, the Pronunciation Coach backend will apply the stages of domain engineering as follows:

- The system will acquire domain knowledge through stakeholder interviews, literature review, and field observations documenting how learners and tutors engage with pronunciation practice.

- The system will analyze recurring entities such as Learner, Tutor, PronunciationAttempt, Feedback, and PracticeSession, along with behaviors including daily practice, feedback delivery, and progress tracking.

- The system will model these entities and behaviors as data structures within Supabase and event types within xAPI, providing a unified model of how pronunciation learning occurs.

- The system will validate the domain model by ensuring that each xAPI event type accurately reflects real world domain events observed in learner practice.

- The system will form domain theory by defining analytic rules such as streak calculation, accuracy scoring, and progress rate aggregation derived from the domain model to produce measurable backend logic.

The backend architecture will integrate the following domain facets as part of its design approach:

- The system will implement the intrinsics of the domain Learners, Tutors, Pronunciation Attempts, Feedback Responses, and Progress Records within Supabase as core data entities.

- The system will utilize support technology, including Supabase and xAPI for event tracking, integrated through the Dart backend.

- The system will define management and organization mechanisms through backend APIs responsible for access control, aggregation jobs, and analytics summaries for learners and tutors.

- The system will enforce rules and regulations through validation logic that ensures each xAPI statement includes required fields and that streak calculations maintain internal consistency.

- The system will model human behavior by encoding learner motivation patterns such as daily streaks, point accumulation, and visual progress indicators through event logging and analytics responses.

By grounding the backend in domain engineering principles, the architecture will ensure that every stored record, computed metric, and API response corresponds directly to authentic learner-tutor interactions observed in the real world. The planned integration of Supabase as the storage infrastructure and xAPI as the event standard will make the backend both domain-faithful and scalable, bridging the conceptual model of pronunciation learning with its technical implementation.

== 3. Analytic Part

=== 3.1 Concept Analysis

==== 3.1.1 Domain Concept Analysis

**Source Material Analysis**: The domain rough sketch contains multiple references to learner motivation patterns. Maria Gonzalez states "I want to practice every day but I forget" while David Chen emphasizes "Daily practice is essential but hard to maintain motivation." Analysis reveals the common concept of **practice consistency** as a central challenge requiring systematic support.

**Terminology Unification**: Interview subjects use varied terms for the same concepts. Maria refers to "saying words correctly" while David mentions "pronunciation accuracy." The analysis establishes **pronunciation accuracy** as the unified concept encompassing both learner attempts and objective measurement standards.

**Abstract Concept Formation**: Multiple interview references to "immediate feedback," "knowing if I'm improving," and "progress tracking" indicate an underlying need for **learning validation**. This concept abstracts individual feedback mechanisms into a broader domain requirement for learner confidence and motivation maintenance.

**Temporal Pattern Analysis**: Observations reveal different practice duration preferences (5 minutes vs. 30 minutes) but consistent emphasis on daily engagement. Analysis abstracts these specifics into the concept of **adaptive learning intensity** where duration varies but consistency remains constant.

==== 3.1.2 Requirements Concept Analysis

**User Story Analysis**: Examination of user stories reveals recurring patterns around "so that I can improve" and "so that I know." Analysis identifies **learner agency** as a meta-concept where users seek both capability enhancement and knowledge confirmation about their progress.

**Persona Consolidation**: Three personas (Maria, David, Carmen) share common traits despite different contexts. Analysis reveals **time-constrained motivated learner** as the core user archetype, with variations in available time rather than fundamental learning approach differences.

**Feature Abstraction**: Multiple user stories reference different aspects of feedback (visual, specific guidance, progress tracking). Analysis consolidates these into **multi-modal feedback system** concept supporting various learning preferences and contexts.

=== 3.2 Validation and Verification

==== 3.2.1 Requirements Validation

**Scenario-Based Validation**: Generated specific learning scenarios to validate understanding with potential users. Example scenario: "Maria has maintained a 10-day streak but misses practice on day 11 due to work emergency. On day 12, she completes practice again." Stakeholder feedback confirmed that streak interruption should reset to 1 rather than continuing from 10, validating the implemented streak logic.

**Persona Validation**: Presented detailed personas to language learning center coordinator who confirmed accuracy of time constraints and motivation patterns. Suggested addition of technology anxiety factor for older learners, indicating potential future persona expansion.

**User Story Validation**: Conducted walkthrough of user stories with ESL students who confirmed relevance of daily practice challenges and pronunciation feedback needs. Students suggested additional stories around family name pronunciation, expanding scope considerations.

==== 3.2.2 Design Verification

**State Management Verification**: Conducted unit testing of MyAppState pace selection persistence across application lifecycle. Verified that pace selection survives application termination and restart cycles.

**UI Component Verification**: Performed manual testing of PaceSelector animations and visual feedback across different device screen sizes. Confirmed consistent color theming and touch responsiveness.

**Gamification Logic Verification**: Tested UserProgress streak calculation logic with various date scenarios including timezone changes, missed days, and consecutive completions. Verified correct point accumulation and streak management.

==== 3.2.3 Implementation Validation

**Audio Integration Readiness**: Analyzed Flutter audio package capabilities against pronunciation feedback requirements. Identified suitable packages (flutter_sound, audio_waveforms) for future implementation phases.

**Performance Validation**: Conducted basic performance testing of SharedPreferences operations under simulated concurrent user scenarios. Verified acceptable response times for progress data persistence.

**Cross-Platform Validation**: Tested current implementation across iOS simulator and Android emulator to verify consistent behavior and appearance across target platforms.
