=== 1.2 Current Situation, Needs, Ideas

==== 1.2.1 Current Situation

For native Spanish speakers, learning and pronouncing English words and phrases presents a significant challenge
due to fundamental differences between the two languages. English, with its influences from Latin, Germanic, and Nordic 
languages, features complex and often inconsistent rules, which can be daunting for learners. The primary difficulties are 
rooted in pronunciation, where specific phonetic elements in English simply do not exist in Spanish. These challenges, 
while not always a complete barrier to being understood, can hinder professional integration and career advancement 
for ambitious non-native speakers.

== 2. Descriptive Part

=== 2.1 Domain Description

==== 2.1.1 Domain Rough Sketch

_(This section is a preliminary sketch based on the research made by team 1)_

* User: Spanish-speaking adult, motivated to learn, may be frustrated with current tools.
* Goal: Improve English pronunciation.
* Activity: Logs into app, sees progress, selects a practice module, records their voice, receives feedback, tracks improvement.
* System: Mobile app, requires login, has home dashboard, practice sections, profile.
* Data: User account, authentication tokens, progress data, practice history.

==== 2.1.2 Terminology

* Phoneme: The smallest unit of sound in a language that can distinguish words (e.g., /θ/ in "think" vs. /s/ in "sink").
* Authentication: The process of verifying a user's identity (e.g., via email and password).
* JWT (JSON Web Token): A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties, used for securing authentication.
* State Management: The handling of the state of the application (e.g., whether a user is logged in or not) in a predictable way.
* Component Library: A collection of reusable UI elements (buttons, input fields, cards) that ensure design consistency.
* Routing/Navigation: The mechanism for moving between different screens in the application.

==== 2.1.3 Domain Terminology vs Rough Sketch

The terminology was derived from analyzing the needs of the domain (language learning) and the technical solution (a Flutter app).  
Terms like *Phoneme* and *Progress* come from the educational domain, while *JWT*, *State Management*, and *Routing* are technical concepts required to build a secure and functional application shell.

==== 2.1.4 Narrative

A user, Maria, wants to improve her English pronunciation.  
She downloads the Pronunciation Coach app. Upon opening it, she is presented with a clean login screen. She enters her credentials and is securely authenticated.  

She arrives at her home page, which welcomes her and shows her current learning streak, recent progress, and suggests a new sound to practice. The app is intuitive, responsive, and makes her feel confident to start her practice session.

==== 2.1.5 Events, Actions, Behaviors

* Event: User presses the "Login" button.
* Action: The system validates the input fields and sends credentials to the authentication service.
* Behavior: If authentication is successful, the application's state changes to "authenticated," and the user is navigated to the Home screen.

==== 2.1.6 Function Signatures

(High-level domain operations, not final code)

* `authenticateUser(credentials: Credentials): AuthenticationResult` - Validates user credentials.
* `navigateTo(screen: ScreenName)` - Changes the current view of the application.
* `getUserProfile(userId: UserID): UserProfile` - Retrieves the user's data for display on the home screen.

=== 2.2 Requirements

==== 2.2.1 User Stories, Epics, Features

*Epic: User Authentication*
* As a new user, I want to log in with my email and password so that I can access my personalized learning content.
* As a user, I want to see clear error messages if my login fails so that I can correct my information.
* As a user, I want my session to be managed securely so that my account remains protected.

*Epic: Application Foundation*
* As a developer, I want a well-organized project structure following clean architecture so that the codebase is maintainable and scalable.
* As a developer, I want a central state management solution so that the user's authentication state can be shared across the app.
* As a developer, I want a library of reusable UI components so that we can ensure design consistency and speed up development.

*Epic: Home Dashboard*
* As a user, I want to see a welcoming home screen after logging in so that I can understand my current progress and see what to do next.
* As a user, I want the app to work offline and show my cached data so that I can still see my progress without an internet connection.

==== 2.2.2 Personas

* *Maria, the Motivated Learner*: A 28-year-old professional from Mexico. She uses English at work but is self-conscious about her accent. She is tech-savvy and uses her phone for most tasks. She needs structured, feedback-driven practice she can fit into her busy schedule.
* *Carlos, the Consistent Student*: A 45-year-old teacher from Colombia preparing to move to an English-speaking country. He is dedicated but has limited time. He needs clear goals, progress tracking, and motivation to practice daily.

==== 2.2.3 Domain Requirements

1. The system must restrict access to user-specific data until identity is verified (authentication).
2. The system must provide a clear and intuitive path for the user to begin their learning activities.
3. The system must present information (progress, goals) in a motivating and visually clear way.

==== 2.2.4 Interface Requirements

* The login screen shall have input fields for email and password.
* The login screen shall have a button with the label "Login".
* The home screen shall display a welcome message containing the user's name.
* The application shall transition from the login screen to the home screen upon successful authentication.

==== 2.2.5 Machine Requirements

* The application shall render correctly on iOS and Android devices.
* The initial app startup time shall be under 400ms on a mid-range device.

== 3. Analytic Part

=== 3.1 Concept Analysis

The rough sketch identified key domain entities: User, Practice, and Progress.  
These abstractions led to the terminology that defines both the problem space (phoneme, feedback) and the solution space (authentication, routing, state).  

The narrative connects these concepts into a coherent user journey, validating that the initial implementation focus (authentication and home screen) correctly establishes the foundation for the user's interaction with the app.  

The technical research (auth security, architecture) ensures the solution space concepts are implemented robustly.

=== 3.2 Validation and Verification

*Testing Plans:* As per Research #14 and #19, testing will include:
** Unit Tests: For the SessionController state changes (login/logout logic).
** Widget Tests: For Login Screen input validation and button enabling/disabling.
** Integration Tests: For the complete flow from Login to Home navigation.

*Walkthroughs:* The team will conduct peer code reviews on all pull requests to verify architecture adherence and code quality.

*Scenarios used for validation:*
1. Happy Path: Enter valid credentials -> Login button enables -> Press button -> Navigates to Home.
2. Validation Error: Enter invalid email format -> Error message appears under field -> Login button remains disabled.
3. Authentication Error: Enter incorrect credentials -> SnackBar with generic error message appears.
4. Offline Scenario: With no internet, the Home screen should still render any cached data.
