_(This section is a preliminary sketch based on the research made by team 1)_

* User: Spanish-speaking adult, motivated to learn, may be frustrated with current tools ðŸ†• **and application loading times**
* Goal: Improve English pronunciation.
* Activity: Logs into app, ðŸ†• **sees engaging loading animations with pronunciation tips**, sees progress, selects a practice module, records their voice, receives feedback, tracks improvement.
* System: Mobile app, requires login, has home dashboard, practice sections, profile ðŸ†• **advanced loading component system**.
* Data: User account, authentication tokens, progress data, practice history ðŸ†• **loading strategies and pronunciation facts**.

==== 2.1.2 Terminology

* Phoneme: The smallest unit of sound in a language that can distinguish words (e.g., /Î¸/ in "think" vs. /s/ in "sink").
* Authentication: The process of verifying a user's identity (e.g., via email and password).
* JWT (JSON Web Token): A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties, used for securing authentication.
* State Management: The handling of the state of the application (e.g., whether a user is logged in or not) in a predictable way.
* Component Library: A collection of reusable UI elements (buttons, input fields, cards) that ensure design consistency.
* Routing/Navigation: The mechanism for moving between different screens in the application.
* ðŸ†• **LoadingStrategy**: A design pattern implementation for interchangeable loading animations
* ðŸ†• **Factory Pattern**: A creational pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass
* ðŸ†• **Observer Pattern**: A behavioral pattern for notifying multiple objects about state changes
* ðŸ†• **Decorator Pattern**: A structural pattern that adds behavior to objects without altering their structure

==== 2.1.3 Domain Terminology vs Rough Sketch

The terminology was derived from analyzing the needs of the domain (language learning) and the technical solution (a Flutter app).  
Terms like *Phoneme* and *Progress* come from the educational domain, while *JWT*, *State Management*, and *Routing* are technical concepts required to build a secure and functional application shell. ðŸ†• **The loading system terminology (*LoadingStrategy*, *Factory Pattern*, etc.) emerged from addressing user frustration with processing delays and the need for engaging wait states.**

==== 2.1.4 Narrative

A user, Maria, wants to improve her English pronunciation.  
She downloads the Pronunciation Coach app. Upon opening it, she is presented with a clean login screen. She enters her credentials ðŸ†• **and sees an engaging pulsating wave animation with a pronunciation fact about the 'th' sound while the system authenticates her**. She arrives at her home page, which welcomes her and shows her current learning streak, recent progress, and suggests a new sound to practice. The app is intuitive, responsive, ðŸ†• **and maintains engagement even during processing through varied loading strategies**, and makes her feel confident to start her practice session.

==== 2.1.5 Events, Actions, Behaviors

* Event: User presses the "Login" button.
* Action: The system validates the input fields and sends credentials to the authentication service ðŸ†• **while displaying a loading strategy**.
* Behavior: If authentication is successful, the application's state changes to "authenticated," and the user is navigated to the Home screen.
* ðŸ†• **Event: Processing operation begins**
* ðŸ†• **Action: Loading system selects and displays appropriate strategy**
* ðŸ†• **Behavior: User views pronunciation facts while waiting for operation completion**

=== 2.3 Implementation

==== 2.3.1 Selected Fragments of Implementation ðŸ†•

The application is organized using a feature-based modular architecture that separates concerns and promotes maintainability. The structure follows Flutter best practices with clear separation between core functionality, feature modules, and shared components.

*Application Architecture Overview:*

The project is divided into three main sections: core infrastructure, feature modules, and the advanced loading system. The core section contains shared utilities and base components used across the entire application. This includes application constants for consistent styling, reusable widget components, and state management providers.

Feature modules encapsulate specific application functionality. The authentication module handles user login and session management, containing both screen implementations and specialized widgets. The home module manages the main dashboard experience with progress tracking and user interface components.

The loading system represents a significant architectural enhancement, implementing enterprise design patterns to create engaging user experiences during processing operations. This system is structured around six key design patterns that work together to provide varied, educational loading states.

*Loading System Implementation Process:*

The loading process begins when a user triggers an operation that requires processing time, such as authentication. The system uses a Factory Pattern to create appropriate loading strategies, selecting from four distinct visual approaches: pulsating wave animations, progress stage indicators, morphing shape transformations, and text typing simulations.

Each loading strategy follows a consistent Template Method Pattern that ensures all loading states display educational pronunciation facts while maintaining unique visual characteristics. The Strategy Pattern allows these loading types to be interchangeable at runtime, providing variety and preventing user fatigue.

A Singleton Pattern manages the global loading state, ensuring consistent behavior across the entire application. Components throughout the app can observe loading state changes using the Observer Pattern, allowing for coordinated user interface updates during processing operations.

The Decorator Pattern enhances loading presentations with visual features like custom backgrounds and blur effects, creating polished, professional loading experiences. Throughout all loading states, the system displays relevant pronunciation facts from a curated database, turning waiting periods into educational opportunities.

This architectural approach ensures that loading states are not merely functional indicators but integral parts of the educational experience, maintaining user engagement while providing value during inevitable processing delays.

== 3. Analytic Part

=== 3.1 Concept Analysis

The rough sketch identified key domain entities: User, Practice, and Progress.  
These abstractions led to the terminology that defines both the problem space (phoneme, feedback) and the solution space (authentication, routing, state). ðŸ†• **The implementation of the loading system introduced new concepts derived from user experience challenges with processing delays, leading to enterprise design pattern applications.**

The narrative connects these concepts into a coherent user journey, validating that the initial implementation focus (authentication and home screen) ðŸ†• **enhanced with advanced loading states** correctly establishes the foundation for the user's interaction with the app.  

The technical research (auth security, architecture) ðŸ†• **and loading system design patterns** ensures the solution space concepts are implemented robustly ðŸ†• **while maintaining engaging user experience**.

=== 3.2 Validation and Verification

*Testing Plans:* As per Research #14 and #19, testing will include:

** Unit Tests: For the SessionController state changes (login/logout logic) ðŸ†• **and LoadingStrategyFactory strategy creation**.
** Widget Tests: For Login Screen input validation and button enabling/disabling ðŸ†• **and loading animation rendering**.
** Integration Tests: For the complete flow from Login to Home navigation ðŸ†• **including loading state transitions**.

*Walkthroughs:* The team will conduct peer code reviews on all pull requests to verify architecture adherence and code quality ðŸ†• **including loading system design pattern implementation**.

*Scenarios used for validation:*

1. Happy Path: Enter valid credentials -> Login button enables -> Press button -> ðŸ†• **Loading animation displays with pronunciation fact** -> Navigates to Home.
2. Validation Error: Enter invalid email format -> Error message appears under field -> Login button remains disabled.
3. Authentication Error: Enter incorrect credentials -> ðŸ†• **Error-specific loading strategy displays** -> SnackBar with generic error message appears.
4. Offline Scenario: With no internet, the Home screen should still render any cached data ðŸ†• **with appropriate loading states for offline operations**.
5. ðŸ†• **Loading Variety**: Multiple authentication attempts demonstrate different loading strategies and pronunciation facts.
