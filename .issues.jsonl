🎯 Objective\n\nDocument and analyze the **Maintenance Requirements (Section 2.2.9)** for the *Pronunciation Coach* system, focusing on how the app will ensure long-term reliability, adaptability, and quality improvement through defined maintenance categories (Adaptive, Corrective, Perfective, and Preventive).\n\n---\n\n### 📝 Description\n\nThis task involves reviewing and organizing all maintenance-related requirements that ensure the sustainability of the *Pronunciation Coach* system after deployment.\nThe maintenance section includes four key types:\n\n* **Adaptive Maintenance:** Enables the app to evolve by adding new languages, supporting new OS versions, and maintaining accessibility compliance.\n* **Corrective Maintenance:** Establishes a structured process for identifying, reporting, and fixing defects through crash reports, bug prioritization, and hotfix capabilities.\n* **Perfective Maintenance:** Focuses on improving performance, UI/UX, gamification effectiveness, and pronunciation model accuracy based on real user analytics.\n* **Preventive Maintenance:** Emphasizes proactive measures such as security scans, database migration testing, API monitoring, and code quality tracking.\n\nAdditionally, it defines a **Maintenance Process** that includes version control, documentation standards, resource allocation, and measurable success metrics (like Mean Time to Repair and Defect Recurrence Rate).\nThis ensures that the *Pronunciation Coach* system remains stable, scalable, and efficient as technology and user needs evolve.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n* Section **2.2.6 Maintenance Requirements** is fully developed and integrated into the documentation.\n* Includes all four categories of maintenance (Adaptive, Corrective, Perfective, Preventive).\n* Adds subsections for **Maintenance Process**, **Success Metrics**, and **Integration with Existing Requirements**.\n* Each requirement includes clear purpose, rationale, and measurable targets.\n* Aligns with software maintenance best practices and supports long-term sustainability of the app.\n\n---\n\n### 🧪 Testing Plan\n\n* Review that all maintenance categories are properly defined and formatted.\n* Ensure that success metrics are measurable and logically connected to project objectives.\n* Verify that the section links properly to related requirements (Sections 2.2.3–2.2.5 and 3.2).\n* Conduct internal peer review to confirm clarity and consistency across subsections.\n\n---\n\n### ⏱️ Timeframe\n\nEstimated completion time: **2–3

🎯 Objective\nDesign a clear, maintainable object model (class diagrams) that covers quiz session state, per-word aggregates, persistence/sync, prosody evaluation results, and resource managers. The goal is a research spike that produces concrete class diagrams and integration notes that developers can follow.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nThis task produces an object-level design that maps concepts in other artifacts (statecharts, Petri nets, algebraic merge operators, and prosody evaluation) into a set of class definitions and relationships. The deliverable should make it straightforward for developers to implement session flow, local persistence, offline merge logic, and prosody evaluator interfaces, and to connect these classes with other useful chart models.\n\nKey points to cover:\n\nClass structures for session management (Session, Question, Attempt, QuizSummary).\n\nAggregate and merge-related classes that implement algebraic merge operators (Aggregate, MergeOperator, EventIdSet/CompactDeduper).\n\nClasses for prosody evaluation pipelines (AudioSample, ForcedAlignResult, PitchContour, StressDecision, IntonationDecision).\n\nPersistence and sync components (LocalStore, SyncManager, UploadQueue, ExportWorker) and how they interact with the class model and Petri-net resource regions.\n\nClear interfaces and data contracts for the prosody evaluator so the frontend can call it from Dart/Flutter.\n\nMapping notes: for each class, show which statechart place or Petri-net place/transition it corresponds to and the lifecycle methods triggered by transitions.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\nClass diagram(s) in an editable format\n\n For each class: name, main fields, important methods (signatures), and short responsibility note.\n\n Mapping table that links classes to statechart places and Petri-net places/transitions.\n\n Short rationale explaining choices for concurrency control (e.g., immutable aggregates, single-writer uploader, lock-free merge points) and recommended data structures for deduplication (event ID sets, bloom filters).\n\n Minimal Dart type sketches (interfaces / data classes) showing how frontend code can consume evaluator outputs.\n\n Risk and mitigation notes (e.g., large seen-event sets, GC/memory concerns on mobile, race windows between persist and sync).\n\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\n Review diagram correctness with other chart models (verify mapping table).\n\nWalkthrough example flows using the diagrams:\n\nNormal quiz: show class interactions from QuestionDisplayed → Recording → Evaluating → Persisting → ShowingSummary.\n\nOffline + sync: simulate local events being folded into Aggregate, an offline merge with remote aggregates, and an upload via the UploadQueue. Verify the merge operator class behavior and that no data is double-counted.\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: 1 week  \n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [ ] Medium  \n- [✅] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy  \n- [ ] Moderate  \n- [✅] Hard  \n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: @Adriel-bracero  \n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/304/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/304/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}

🎯 Objective\nBuild and integrate a working **hierarchical state machine** (statechart) that directly controls the quiz flow at runtime replacing the current screen-based logic with structured, event-driven state transitions.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nDevelop an **implementation** of a **functional state machine system** that manages the live quiz process through clearly defined states and transitions.  \nThe focus is on *execution and interaction*, not on theoretical modeling.  \nThe implementation should handle all quiz flow stages — from waiting to start, through answering and evaluation, to displaying results — while allowing nested (hierarchical) states and error handling.\n\nThis task demonstrates practical use of **statecharts** in code, showing how runtime state control can simplify flow logic and UI coordination.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] `StateMachine` class implemented with support for nested (hierarchical) states  \n- [ ] Quiz flow states defined (idle → selecting → answering → evaluating → results)  \n- [ ] Event-driven transitions and guards working correctly  \n- [ ] Integrated with quiz UI (buttons, progress, feedback)  \n- [ ] Unit tests verifying transitions, entry/exit actions, and hierarchy behavior  \n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\n- Unit tests for transition logic and event handling  \n- Integration tests confirming quiz state flow correctness  \n- Manual UI checks of quiz progression and recovery from error states  \n- Validation of nested state entry/exit consistency  \n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: 1 week\n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [x] Medium  \n- [ ] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy  \n- [x] Moderate  \n- [ ] Hard  \n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned

🎯 Objective\nBuild a Recent Activity Timeline that displays the user’s last ten challenge results, including their dates and scores, using locally stored progress data.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description  \nWe need to implement a timeline component on the **Dashboard** that visualizes the user’s most recent activity.  \n\n**Requirements:**  \n- Display up to **10 recent challenge results**.  \n- Each entry should include:  \n  - The **challenge title or type**.  \n  - The **date completed**.  \n  - The **score or performance** obtained.  \n- Data should be **retrieved from local storage**, not Supabase (temporary implementation).  \n- Extend \"user_api_service.dart\" to provide a local method for fetching this activity data.  \n\n**Files to modify or create:**  \n- \"app/lib/features/dashboard/widgets/recent_activity_timeline.dart\" → UI timeline component  \n- \"app/lib/core/services/user_api_service.dart\" → Extend with storage logic  \n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria  \n- [ ] Timeline displays the **last 10 challenge results** in reverse chronological order.  \n- [ ] Each item shows **date**, **score**, and **challenge name/type**.  \n- [ ] Handles the case when there is **no activity yet** (shows placeholder or message).  \n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\n- Timeline correctly shows 10 items maximum.  \n- Dates and scores render accurately.  \n- Empty-state message appears when there’s no activity.  \n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\n1 - 2 days\n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [x] Medium  \n- [ ] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ]

🎯 Objective\nImplement a complete, secure, and user-friendly “Forgot Password?” flow in the Pronunciation Coach app using the existing Supabase-based authentication stack, so that users who cannot remember their password can reliably recover access without instructor/admin intervention.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nThis task adds full end-to-end password recovery to the existing auth system. The feature must integrate with the current Supabase Auth configuration used by the project.\n\nWhen a user on the login screen taps “Forgot password?”, they should be taken to a Reset Password Request screen where they can enter their email. Submitting the form will trigger Supabase’s resetPasswordForEmail (or equivalent SDK method) to send a secure reset link to the provided address, using a configured redirectTo URL pointing back into the Pronunciation Coach app. For security, the app must show a generic success message (“If an account exists for this email, a reset link has been sent”) and must not reveal whether the email is registered.\n\nWhen the user opens the reset link from their email, they should be routed to a New Password screen (mobile/web route defined by the team) within Pronunciation Coach. This screen must allow the user to enter and confirm a new password. If the Supabase recovery session/token is valid, the app should call updateUser({ password: newPassword }) (or the appropriate SDK call) to update the password. On success, the user should see a confirmation and either be signed in or taken back to the login screen with a clear “Password updated” message. If the link is invalid or expired, the app should show a friendly error and provide a way to request a new reset email.\n\nThe implementation should:\n\t•\tReuse the project’s existing architecture patterns (e.g., AuthRepository / service layer, navigation, theming).\n\t•\tFollow good security and UX practices (no account enumeration, proper error handling, clear messaging).\n\t•\tAlign with the course’s expectations: requirements-backed, well-structured UI flow, robust integration with Supabase, and a verifiable behavior.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\t•\tUI Entry Point: “Forgot password?” link is visible and accessible on the login screen and navigates to a Reset Password Request screen.\n\t•\tRequest Screen: Screen includes an email input with basic validation and a “Send reset link” action.\n\t•\tReset Email Integration: Submitting a valid email calls Supabase’s password reset API with a configured redirectTo URL that points to the app’s reset-password route.\n\t•\tNo Account Enumeration: After submitting, the app always shows a generic success message without indicating whether the email exists.\n\t•\tNew Password Screen: A dedicated screen/route handles incoming reset links, allows “new password” + “confirm password” entry, and validates them locally.\n\t•\tPassword Update: With a valid recovery session, the app successfully updates the user’s password via Supabase and shows a clear success message.\n\t•\tError Handling: Invalid/expired token, network errors, and invalid inputs display user-friendly messages and safe recovery options (e.g., link to request reset again).\n\t•\tNavigation: After successful reset, user is either logged in or returned to the login screen with a confirmation state; no dead-ends.\n\t•\tConsistency & Accessibility: UI matches existing design, supports keyboard/screen-reader focus order, and uses clear language (e.g., no raw technical error codes).\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\n•\tManual Testing\n\t•\tRequest reset with:\n\t•\tA registered email → confirm reset email received and generic success message shown.\n\t•\tA non-registered email → confirm same generic success message; no indication of account existence.\n\t•\tInvalid email format → inline validation error; no API call.\n\t•\tUse a real reset link:\n\t•\tOpen link → confirm it routes to New Password screen inside the app.\n\t•\tEnter matching valid passwords → confirm success message and ability to log in with new password.\n•\tRegression Checks:\n\t•\tVerify existing login and signup flows still work as before.\n\t•\tVerify “Forgot password?” link and new screens do not break navigation on mobile/web targets.\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: 3 days.\n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [ ] Medium  \n- [x] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy  \n- [x] Moderate  \n- [ ] Hard  \n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: @kevinlara1 ","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/296/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/296/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}

🎯 Objective\nAnalyze how two different Speech to Text  design options, Whisper and Vosk, affect software quality attributes such as accuracy, performance, usability, and verifiability in the Pronunciation Coach architecture. \n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nThe Pronunciation Coach system relies on STT modules to provide pronunciation feedback.\nThe two candidates, Whisper and Vosk, present distinct quality attribute profiles:\n\n- Whisper - Higher accuracy, but more computationally expensive and slower.\n- Vosk - Lower accuracy, but lightweight and fully offline.\n\nThe purpose of this task is as follows:\n\n- Identify two or more quality attributes affected by the choice of STT engine (e.g., accuracy, performance, verifiability).\n\n- Construct a comparison table summarizing how each alternative performs for each attribute.\n\n- Create a simple architecture diagram showing the STT module within the system and where the trade-offs occur.\n\n- Write a short discussion paragraph describing how the trade-offs relate to the system’s overall quality goals and non-functional requirements.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\nList the conditions that must be met for this issue to be considered complete.  \n- [ ] Includes a comparison table covering at least two quality attributes.\n- [ ] Provides a diagram showing where the trade-offs occur in the architecture.\n- [ ] Offers

🎯 Objective\nApply Design Rationale Documentation principles from Risk Analysis File [Chapter 3 (slides 43 - 45)] to record why specific interface design choices were made for the Pronunciation Feedback Display.\nThe goal is to strengthen the documentation process by formally linking each design decision to the underlying problem, explored alternatives, and justification.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nThis task focuses on the structure and traceability of design reasoning rather than NFR trade-offs.\nFollowing Van Lamsweerde’s approach, the documentation will explicitly capture:\n\n- The decision question (e.g., \"How should pronunciation feedback be shown?\")\n\n- The alternatives considered (e.g., text, visual, or audio-based feedback)\n\n- The criteria for selection (based on user context, accessibility, or learning flow)\n\n- The final rationale explaining why the chosen design best meets project goals.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria \n- [ ] Document at least one design decision record (DDR) entry following the rationale structure: Question → Alternatives → Criteria → Decision → Justification.\n- [ ] Include at least three alternatives and specify which was selected.\n- [ ] Insert the record under Section 3.3 Design Decision Rationale in the documentation.\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\n- Check that each documented decision follows the full rationale structure.\n- Verify all alternatives and criteria are explicitly listed.\n- Confirm the reasoning is understandable without needing additional context.\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\n2 - 4

🎯 Objective\nDefine, analyze, and apply Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) in software projects, focusing on how different quality attributes (performance, usability, security, availability, maintainability) interact and trade off during system design decisions.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nThis lecture topic task explores how NFRs shape the architecture and behavior of a system. While functional requirements specify what the software does, NFRs determine how well it performs. Students will identify key NFR categories, describe measurable quality attributes, and analyze how improving one may negatively affect another. Examples include conflicts like performance vs. security or usability vs. reliability. The task connects concepts from the Requirements Engineering and Software Design lectures, using real-world cases such as an airline timetable or e-commerce platform to demonstrate how engineers balance system qualities under constraints.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n- Define at least five main NFR categories (e.g., performance, usability, security, availability, maintainability).\n- Provide one concrete example and measurable metric for each NFR.\n- Create a trade-off matrix comparing at least three quality attributes.\n- Include a short scenario (airline timetable, web app, etc.) showing a real design decision between conflicting NFRs.\n- Explain how developers can evaluate and verify NFR satisfaction (tests, logs, metrics).\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\n- Review examples for clarity and completeness of NFR definitions.\n- Check that each NFR has measurable criteria and potential verification method.\n- Validate trade-off reasoning using one sample system scenario.\n- Peer-review deliverable for consistency with lecture materials (Requirements & Design).\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: 1/2 days\n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [ ] Medium  \n- [ ] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy  \n- [ ] Moderate  \n- [ ] Hard  \n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: @aryamdiaz \n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/277/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/277/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}

🎯 Objective\nConnect the achievements section to real user data from Supabase by integrating with the existing UserProgress API, replacing hardcoded dummy values with actual user stats.\n\n---\n\n## 📝

🎯 Objective\nApply Conflict Management principles from Chapter 3 (slides 6-14) to identify and resolve inconsistencies between competing requirements in the gamification system, specifically focusing on streak mechanics vs. user flexibility needs.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nThis task focuses on Inconsistency Management, particularly detecting and resolving conflicts between stakeholder viewpoints. According to slide 8, conflicts occur when requirements cannot be satisfied together, either as:\n\n- Strong Conflicts: Logically inconsistent statements that can never both be true\n- Weak Conflicts (Divergence): Requirements that conflict only under specific boundary conditions\n\nIn Pronunciation Coach, we have identified potential conflicts between:\n\n1. Motivation requirements (strict daily streaks keep users engaged)\n2. Flexibility requirements (users need forgiveness for missed days)\n3. Progress requirements (XP should reflect actual effort)\n\nKey Lecture Concepts Applied:\n\n- Conflict detection using overlapping statements (slide 10)\n- Conflict resolution tactics (slide 13)\n- Systematic conflict management process (slides 10-14)\n\nWhy This Matters:\nOur persons show conflicting needs: Maria (commuter) needs flexibility for unpredictable schedules, while David (dedicated learner) wants strict accountability. These viewpoints create requirement conflicts that must be resolved before implementation.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\nPart 1: Conflict Detection (slides 10-11)\n- [ ] Identify at least 3 pairs of conflicting requirements from existing documentation (Section 2.2)\n- [ ] Classify each conflict as Strong or Weak with clear boundary conditions\n- [ ] Document which personas or stakeholder viewpoints are in conflict\n- [ ] Create an Interaction Matrix showing overlaps and conflicts between requirements\n\nPart 2: Conflict Analysis (slide 8-9)\n- [ ] For each weak conflict, clearly state the boundary condition that triggers the conflict\n- [ ] Document the root cause (stakeholder objectives, non-functional trade-offs, etc.)\n- [ ] Identify which requirements have the most conflicts (conflict count analysis)\n\nPart 3: Resolution Generation (slide 12-13)\n- [ ] Generate at least 2 alternative resolutions for each conflict using resolution tactics:\n- Avoid boundary condition\n- Restore conflicting statements\n- Weaken conflicting statements\n- Drop lower-priority statements\n- Specialize conflict source or target\n- [ ] Document trade-offs for each proposed resolution\n\nPart 4: Resolution Selection (slide 14)\n- [ ] Select preferred resolution for each conflict based on:\n- Contribution to critical NFRs (user retention, engagement)\n- Impact on other conflicts/risks\n- [ ] Document rationale for each selection\n- [ ] Update Section 2.2 with resolved requirements\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\nValidation with Persons\n- Review each conflict with team to confirm it represents real stakeholder tension\n- Map each conflict back to specific user stories from Section 2.2.1\n- Verify boundary conditions are realistic (check with ESL students if possible)\n\nResolution Feasibility\n- Confirm selected resolutions can be implemented within current architecture\n- Verify resolutions don't create new conflicts\n- Check if resolutions align with Section 2.2.4-2.2.5 interface/machine requirements\n\nDocumentation Completeness\n- Ensure all conflicts are traceable to source requirements\n- Verify interaction matrix correctly identifies overlaps\n- Confirm new resolved requirements are added to Section 2.2\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: 3-4 hours\n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [X] Medium  \n- [ ] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy  \n- [X] Moderate  \n- [ ] Hard  \n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: @Gabriel-Visbal \n","closed_by":{"login":"Yulio7","id":90105310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMTA1MzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90105310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7","html_url":"https://github.com/Yulio7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/272/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/272/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

Objective\n\nCreate a simple, user-friendly Settings Page that allows users to manage app preferences such as theme, sound options, and language selection.\n\n⸻\n\n📝 Description\n\nWe need to design and implement a basic Settings Screen for the Pronunciation Coach app.\nThe purpose of this screen is to give users control over their app experience and personalize their interaction with the app.\n\nThe settings page will include:\n\t•\tTheme Toggle (Light/Dark Mode): Allows users to switch between light and dark appearance.\n\t•\tAudio Preferences: Option to enable/disable pronunciation feedback sounds and adjust playback speed (e.g., 0.75x, 1x, 1.25x) etc.\n\t•\tLanguage Selection: Dropdown or segmented control to choose app interface language (initially English and Spanish).\n\t•\tReset Progress: Button to clear saved pronunciation history and progress (with confirmation prompt).\n\t•\tAbout Section: Displays app version and brief description.\n\nDesign will follow the app’s minimalist, clean style (matching current color palette and typography).\nThe layout should be responsive, with a scrollable column containing grouped setting tiles or cards.\n\n⸻\n\n✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\t•\tSettings page is accessible from the navigation bar or home screen\n\t•\tTheme toggle updates app theme instantly\n\t•\tAudio preferences can be adjusted and saved locally\n\t•\tLanguage selection updates displayed text after selection\n\t•\tReset progress triggers confirmation dialog and clears stored user data\n\t•\t“About” section shows app version and developer info\n\t•\tLayout works on both mobile and tablet screen sizes\n\n⸻\n\n🧪 Testing Plan\n\t•\tTest theme toggle persistence after app restart\n\t•\tTest playback speed and audio toggle functionality\n\t•\tTest that reset progress properly clears user data\n\t•\tVerify correct localization when switching languages\n\t•\tManual UI testing on different devices and screen

🎯 Objective\nExpand section 2.1 “Domain Description” of Team 4’s documentation by adding a new subsection 2.1.7 the models how observable instances (phenomena) and abstractions (concepts) describe the quiz’s entities, functions, and behaviors referencing the lecture material on Phenomena and Concepts (phenomena-concepts.pdf). \n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nAccording to the lecture material on Phenomena and Concepts (phenomena-concepts.pdf), a phenomenon is an observable, concrete instance that can be sensed or measured, while a concept is an abstraction or class that represents a set of related phenomena. This issue focuses on identifying and classifying the phenomena and concepts present in the quiz algorithm in the creation of a new subsection 2.1.7 \"Phenomena and Concepts for Quiz Feature\". The new subsection will identify and categorize the entities, functions, and events/behaviors that make up the quiz, describing how concrete, measurable elements (phenomena) relate to abstract structures (concepts).\n\nThe analysis will include:\n\n- Entities: Concepts that carry data, such as Word, IPA, Syllables, OptionSet, and QuizState.\n- Functions: Operations that act on those entities, such as Get_Word_IPA(word) or Generate_Evil_Words(word).\n- Events and behaviors: Observable actions during quiz execution, such as WordRequested, OptionsGenerated, and OptionSelected.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n- [x] New section 2.1.7 \"Phenomena and Concepts for Quiz Feature\" is added to Team 4's documentation.\n- [x] The information is consistent with the lecture material (phenomena-concepts.pdf).\n- [x] Clearly defines and differentiates phenomena and concepts in the quiz feature.\n- [x] Categorizes relevant entities, functions, and events/behaviors as discussed in the lecture.\n- [x] Demonstrates how identified phenomena and concepts align with the quiz’s behaviors and requirements.\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\n- Ensure all classifications correctly follow the lecture framework.\n- Verify that each entity, function, and event corresponds to an existing component of the quiz.\n- Confirm all phenomenon to concept mappings are clear.\n- Ensure that the section logically complements the rest of the documentation.\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: 3 days \n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [x] Medium  \n- [ ] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy  \n- [x] Moderate  \n- [ ] Hard  \n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: _@iralys-sanchez18_  \n","closed_by":{"login":"Yulio7","id":90105310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMTA1MzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90105310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7","html_url":"https://github.com/Yulio7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/263/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/263/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

🎯 Objective\nAnalyze and document potential failures in the Pronunciation Feedback Audio Processing Module using Risk Tree Analysis (Chapter 3, slides 21–22). The goal is to identify how different component-level failures can lead to the main system risk: “Inaccurate Pronunciation Feedback Provided.”\n\nThis task deepens the general Risk Analysis process by applying it to a specific technical area, illustrating how structured failure decomposition supports early detection and mitigation of reliability issues within the Pronunciation Coach system.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nThis activity applies Risk Tree Analysis to visualize and understand how multiple audio-related issues can combine to affect feedback accuracy. The diagram should represent hierarchical relationships among potential failure sources and show how they logically contribute to the main risk.\n\nSteps:\n- Define the root risk: \"Inaccurate Pronunciation Feedback Provided.\"\n- Identify intermediate nodes: Subsystems such as microphone capture, MFCC feature extraction, and native model comparison.\n- Break down into leaf nodes: Specific, measurable failure events (e.g., microphone static, sampling rate mismatch, corrupted MFCC coefficients).\n- Connect with logic gates (AND/OR): Indicate whether combinations of failures are required or if one alone is sufficient.\n\n**Lecture Concepts Applied:**\n\n- Risk Tree structure (slide 21)\n- AND/OR failure nodes (slide 21)\n- Leaf nodes vs decomposable nodes (slide 22)\n\nWhy This Matters:\nThe MFCC-based pronunciation system (mentioned in Section 2.1.5) depends on reliable audio capture and processing. Understanding failure combinations helps us prioritize which components need the most robust error handling.\n\n**Deliverable:** A documented risk tree diagram showing:\n\n- Root risk: \"Inaccurate Pronunciation Feedback Provided\"\n- Component failures: microphone, MFCC algorithm, native models\n- Logical relationships (AND/OR nodes)\n- Leaf nodes representing basic failure events\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n-  [ ] Risk tree diagram created (draw.io, Mermaid, or hand-drawn + photo)\n-  [ ] Root node clearly identifies main system risk\n-  [ ] At least 3 levels of decomposition (root → intermediate → leaf nodes)\n-  [ ] AND/OR logic nodes properly labeled\n-  [ ] Minimum 8 leaf nodes identified (specific failure events)\n-  [ ] Documentation added to Section 2.2 or Logbook\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\n- Review with team to verify failure scenarios are realistic\n- Cross-reference with existing requirements (Section 2.2.4-2.2.5)\n- Validate against personas (Maria's bus scenario, David's practice sessions)\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: 2-3 hours\n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [X] Medium  \n- [ ] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [X] Easy  \n- [ ] Moderate  \n- [ ] Hard  \n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: @Gabriel-Visbal \n","closed_by":{"login":"Yulio7","id":90105310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMTA1MzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90105310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7","html_url":"https://github.com/Yulio7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/261/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/261/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

🎯 Objective\nDefine and justify a concrete set of accessibility and inclusive design requirements for the Pronunciation Coach app, based on recognized accessibility standards and mobile guidelines, so the team can better support learners with diverse abilities while aligning this work with the course topics on requirements engineering and software design.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nThis Lecture Topic Task is a research-based activity focused on treating accessibility as a first-class quality attribute for the app. The work consists of reviewing relevant accessibility resources (such as WCAG 2.2, platform-specific accessibility guidelines for iOS and Android, and reputable usability references) and identifying which principles are most applicable to Pronunciation Coach’s core flows: onboarding, recording speech, receiving feedback, viewing scores/progress, and navigating exercises. This research will produce a concise set of accessibility and inclusive design requirements tailored specifically to pronunciation feedback scenarios and anxiety-reducing language learning. They will address needs for users with visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive limitations. The outcome will be a PDF that summarizes the research sources and presents the derived requirements in a structured way.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\t•\tPDF attached in this issue’s comments containing a brief literature review of relevant accessibility standards and guidelines.\n\t•\tAt least 10–15 clear, testable accessibility requirements defined and categorized, explicitly tailored to Pronunciation Coach use cases.\n\t•\tRequirements address multiple user needs (visual, auditory, motor, cognitive) and are specific to the pronunciation-learning context (recording, feedback, progress, etc.).\n\t•\tA one-page Accessibility Checklist is included in the PDF for developers/testers to apply to existing and future app screens and features.\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\n\t•\tReview each derived requirement against the cited accessibility guidelines to ensure alignment and correctness.\n\t•\tPerform an internal peer review with at least one teammate to confirm that the requirements are understandable, feasible, and relevant to the current Pronunciation Coach design.\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: 1–2 days\n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [x] Low  \n- [ ] Medium  \n- [ ] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [x] Easy  \n- [ ] Moderate  \n- [ ] Hard  \n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: @kevinlara1 ","closed_by":{"login":"Yulio7","id":90105310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMTA1MzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90105310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7","html_url":"https://github.com/Yulio7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/260/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/260/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

🎯 Objective\nIntegrate the principles of Requirements Evaluation into the Pronunciation Coach documentation by showing how requirement conflicts and system risks can be identified, analyzed, and resolved systematically during the app’s planning and feature design.\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nThe Requirements Evaluation lecture by Axel Van Lamsweerde emphasizes how inconsistencies, conflicts, and risks in requirements can threaten project success. Applying these ideas, this documentation will:\n\n- Identify potential conflicts between functional and non-functional requirements (e.g., accuracy vs. responsiveness).\n\n- Describe how risk analysis and requirements prioritization ensure a more stable design process.\n\n- Explain how negotiation and alternative selection strategies support balanced development decisions in Pronunciation Coach.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\nList the conditions that must be met for this issue to be considered complete.  \n- [ ] Documentation includes a brief explanation of the Requirements Evaluation lecture concepts.\n- [ ] Identifies at least one example of a conflict or risk relevant to Pronunciation Coach.\n- [ ] Describes how such conflicts or risks could be detected and mitigated in future development.\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\nHow will this be tested?  \n- Peer review the document to verify conceptual accuracy.\n- Confirm that identified risks/conflicts relate to real project scenarios.\n- Ensure explanations are clearly linked to the original lecture.\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion: 2–3 days\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [ ] Medium  \n- [ ] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy  \n- [ ] Moderate  \n- [ ] Hard  \n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: _@klrskevin_  \n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/259/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/259/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}

🎯 Objective\nStudy how Petri nets can model, analyze, and validate concurrent aspects of the quiz flow and offline sync/merge logic, and produce implementable artifacts (models, diagrams, simulation scripts, and integration notes) that help developers detect deadlocks, resource contention, and ensure liveness and boundedness in the app workflow.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nUsing the Petri nets lecture as reference, investigate how Petri net models (place-transition nets or colored Petri nets, where appropriate) can represent:\n\nThe quiz session lifecycle and per-question interaction (display → answer → prompt → recording → evaluation → persist → next).\n\nConcurrent/shared resources (microphone, network/upload queue, export worker) and how those resources are allocated.\n\nOffline/online synchronization and merge operations (how concurrent syncs and merges interact).\n\nProduce clear Petri net diagrams, a short primer linking lecture concepts to our system, and a small prototype or simulation (script or model file) that exercises typical concurrent scenarios (simultaneous uploads, interrupted recording, resume + merge).\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\nShort primer (1 page) mapping Petri net concepts from the lecture to our app (places, transitions, tokens, firing rules, marking) and why those properties matter (deadlock, liveness, boundedness).\n\n Petri net diagrams:\n\nA place-transition net for the quiz session flow (single session).\n\nA net that models concurrent sync/merge processes and shared resources (microphone, network).\n\n A simulation/prototype (small script or model file for a Petri net tool) that can run scenarios and produce traces or reachability checks (examples: simulate two concurrent uploads, simulate crash-and-resume with merge). Include instructions to run it.\n\n Analysis notes showing findings for each model: possible deadlocks, resource contention, required capacity bounds (e.g., queue size), and recommended guards or redesigns to avoid issues.\n\n Deliverables packaged as editable files (diagram SVG or PNG, model/simulation file, and a short DOCX or Markdown report). \n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\nCreate scenario scripts or model inputs for the simulation: normal flow, concurrent uploads, recording while an upload is ongoing, crash during upload then resume and merge.\n\nFor each scenario, run the model and inspect markings and firing sequences to check:\n\nNo reachable deadlock states in normal operation.\n\nBoundedness: no unbounded token growth (queue overflow) under expected load.\n\nLiveness: critical transitions (e.g., persist, export) remain fireable under reasonable conditions.\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: 2 days / 1 week \n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [ ] Medium  \n- [✅] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy  \n- [ ] Moderate  \n- [✅] Hard  \n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: @Adriel-bracero  \n","closed_by":{"login":"Yulio7","id":90105310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMTA1MzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90105310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7","html_url":"https://github.com/Yulio7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/258/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/258/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

🎯 Objective\nCreate a centralized, reusable Sound Effects Service to provide auditory feedback for user interactions across the entire Pronounciation Coach App.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nThe application currently lacks auditory feedback, which is a key element for an engaging and responsive user experience. We need to implement a centralized Sound Effects Service to provide consistent audio feedback for user interactions across the entire Pronounciation Coach App.\n\nThis service must be designed for reusability and easy maintenance. Future developers should be able to add new sounds or update existing ones without refactoring application logic, by simply modifying a configuration file.\n\n**Interactions requiring sound could include for now:**\n\n- Correct/incorrect answer feedback\n \n- Tapping any button or interactive element\n \n- Pressing the record button\n \n- App navigation (e.g., moving to a new screen)\n\n_*As the app is developed further, developers could add more sound effects if needed_\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n- A SoundService class is implemented with a simple API (e.g., play('success')).\n\n- The service is instantiated once and accessible app-wide (e.g., via a context or service locator).\n\n- All sound files are organized in a dedicated /assets/sounds/ directory.\n\n- A configuration file (e.g., sounds.json) maps sound identifiers to their file paths.\n\n- The service includes a method to pre-load critical sounds for immediate playback.\n\n- Sound effects are successfully integrated for at least the following: correct answer, incorrect answer, button tap, and record button.\n\n- The implementation is decoupled from UI components, allowing any part of the app to trigger sounds.\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\n\n- **Unit Tests:** Verify that SoundService methods are called with correct parameters from mocked UI components.\n\n- **Integration Testing:** Manually test each interaction (e.g., button press, correct answer) to ensure the correct sound plays without audio lag or console errors.\n\n- **Extensibility Test:** Demonstrate adding a new sound effect by only adding a file to the assets and a new entry in the config file, without changing the SoundService code.\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: Aproximetly 3 days   \n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [ ] Medium  \n- [ ] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy  \n- [ ] Moderate  \n- [ ] Hard  \n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: @FabianVelezOcasio  \n","closed_by":{"login":"Yulio7","id":90105310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMTA1MzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90105310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7","html_url":"https://github.com/Yulio7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/257/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/257/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

🎯 Objective\nCollect all phonetic features from user and reference audio needed to populate the pronunciation dashboard.\nExample: Extract phoneme-level duration, pitch, intensity, formants, and MFCCs for each audio sample.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nWe need to gather and store phonetic data to enable the dashboard visualizations and rule-based feedback.\nThe task involves extracting features from both user audio and perfect reference audio (TTS or curated).\n\nFeatures to collect per phoneme:\n- Duration (start, end, duration)\n- Pitch (mean_pitch, F0)\n- Voiced ratio\n- Intensity\n- Formants (F1, F2, F3)\n- MFCCs (mfcc_1 to mfcc_13)\n\nAdditional metadata for dashboard calculations:\n- Total number of words and phonemes\n- Average phoneme duration\n- Audio-level stats: total duration, average pitch, average intensity\n\nThis data will be used for:\n- Phoneme timeline visualization\n- Pitch and intensity contours\n- Formant plots for vowels\n- Rule-based feedback highlighting pronunciation errors\n\nReference: extraction is done using parselmouth + praatio for TextGrid parsing, following the current feature extraction implementation.\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Features are extracted for all phonemes in user audio\n- [ ] Features are extracted for all phonemes in perfect reference audio\n- [ ] Phoneme durations and counts are calculated\n- [ ] Data is saved in a structured format (DataFrame / CSV) ready for dashboard consumption\n- [ ] Edge cases handled: short phonemes, unvoiced segments, TTS vs natural audio\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\n- Run extraction on a test sentence with multiple phonemes\n- Compare output with expected DataFrame structure\n- Verify no critical values are missing (None values allowed for very short segments)\n- Confirm reference audio extraction matches user audio structure\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: 1 week\n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [ ] Medium  \n- [ ] High

🎯 Objective\nAutomate the generation of project documentation by converting .adoc files into .pdf files through a GitHub Actions workflow.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nWe need to ensure that all documentation within the repository (project handbook, research topics, and team deliverables) is automatically built and versioned.\nThis will be achieved using an AsciiDoc-to-PDF CI pipeline configured via GitHub Actions.\n\nThe workflow detects any changes made to .adoc files in the docs/ directory and automatically:\n\nBuilds PDFs using the asciidoctor/docker-asciidoctor container.\n\nCommits the generated PDFs back into the repository under docs/pdf/.\n\nEnsures continuous documentation updates alongside code commits.\n\nThis feature enforces consistency, avoids outdated documentation, and aligns with DevOps principles of Documentation as Code.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\nList the conditions that must be met for this issue to be considered complete.  \n- [ ] Workflow triggers automatically on .adoc file changes.  \n- [ ] PDFs are generated successfully using asciidoctor-pdf.\n- [ ] Generated PDFs are committed to docs/pdf/ automatically.\n- [ ] Workflow completes without permission or rebase conflicts.\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\nHow will this be tested?  \n- Push updates to an existing .adoc file under docs/ (e.g., docs/research/documents.adoc).\n- Confirm that the workflow runs under Actions → “Build & Commit AsciiDoc PDFs”.\n- Verify the new .pdf file appears in docs/pdf/.\n- Check commit history for chore(docs): update generated PDFs.\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time:  2–3 hours\n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [ ] Medium  \n- [ ] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ]

🎯 Objective\nEnable a 3–6 person team to practice Agile inside an existing Agile system, with the team lead slicing work, assigning clear starter tasks, and helping teammates to open follow-up issues for incremental improvements.\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nWe’ll establish a way for a small team to deliver within an already-running Agile program (e.g., GitHub). The team lead acts as servant-leader + splitter: translating big-picture task into bite-size tasks that are “ready to start,” then handing them out with a minimal starter scaffold. Teammates work on small parts, and when they realize they can further upgrade or optimize, they create new issues (labeled “Follow-up”) rather than expanding scope mid-sprint.\n\nThese tasks would be described / handed out / furthered talked about in team weekly meetings where the Team leader can discuss with his team about the tasks that have already been done and how to further improve them.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\nList the conditions that must be met for this issue to be considered complete.  \n- [x] Weekly meetings with team\n- [x] Constantly discussing about what has been done in issues and how to further improve them\n- [x] Team works on their own upgrades without needing to be 'hand-held' through out the course of the project and development\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\nHow will this be tested?  \n-  Assign specific task to the team \n-  Putting tasks and issues together to form one cohesive program which works (In my team's case, that being the quiz)\n-  Constantly check up on the team's progress\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: _e.g., Course of the project's lifespan. \n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [x] Medium  \n- [ ] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy  \n- [x] Moderate  \n- [ ] Hard  \n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: @Joy-Martinez \n","closed_by":{"login":"Yulio7","id":90105310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMTA1MzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90105310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7","html_url":"https://github.com/Yulio7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/227/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/227/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

🎯 Objective\nEstablish and apply a repeatable method to detect, classify, and resolve requirements conflicts, and produce the Lecture Topic Task.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nI’ve observed ambiguous and conflicting statements in the spec (e.g., mixed meanings of User, time windows expressed as points vs. intervals). In this task I will introduce a 5-step conflict workflow (overlaps → detect → document → generate → select) plus a propagation note, and compile the content into a polished PDF.\n\nScope (initial pass)\n- Target features: Login, Quiz attempts, Feedback/Results.\n- Conflict types to consider: terminology, designation, structure; weak vs. strong.\n\nReferences: my class notes/slides for Requirements Evaluation and Design.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n- A Conflict Log exists in the repo (e.g., docs/conflicts/CONFLICT_LOG.md) with at least 3 entries (CF-IDs).\n- Each entry includes: statements, clash type, strength, boundary (for weak), ≥3 candidate resolutions, decision & rationale, impacted artifacts, verification.\n-  The Glossary is updated with new/clarified terms (e.g., StudentUser, StaffUser, SessionDuration).\n- At least 1 requirement is rewritten to remove a conflict (before/after shown in the PR).\n- Verification hooks are added (at least one unit/widget test or manual step linked in the PR).\n- A mini slide deck (10–12 min) is committed under docs/lectures/ with agenda + examples.\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\n\n- Review checklist: In the PR, I’ll verify each CF-ID entry contains all required fields.\n- Unit/Widget tests:\n  - RB-READONLY-STUDENT (student cannot edit rubric).\n  - RA-EDIT-STAFF (staff can edit rubric).\n  - Boundary test for the feedback window (e.g., 15 minutes after submission).\n- Manual walkthrough: I’ll simulate the accommodation path and confirm the policy-based weakening is respected.\n- CI checks: Markdown links are valid; glossary terms are cross-referenced.\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: 1-2 days\n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [ ] Medium  \n- [ ] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy  \n- [ ] Moderate  \n- [ ] Hard  \n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: @aryamdiaz ","closed_by":{"login":"pedroamorales","id":149693528,"node_id":"U_kgDOCOwkWA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/149693528?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedroamorales","html_url":"https://github.com/pedroamorales","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedroamorales/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedroamorales/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedroamorales/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedroamorales/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedroamorales/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedroamorales/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedroamorales/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedroamorales/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedroamorales/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/225/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/225/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

🎯 Objective\n\nTurn the existing Python TTS multiple-choice quiz into Dart (Flutter), keeping the same behavior and flow.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\n\nPort the Python CLI quiz (with TTS and A–D options) to a Dart/Flutter app. The current Python script:\nSpeaks a prompt: “Choose the correct way of saying <word>”\nGenerates 3 misspellings + 1 correct answer, shuffles, and reads all options A–D in a single utterance\nPrints only the letters A, B, C, D (no words) to the console\nRepeats the same word (reshuffling options) until the user picks the correct one\nSays “Correct!” on success and “Next word.” before moving on. The Dart version should replicate this UX, using a TTS engine and simple UI to select A–D. Keep config flags (e.g., repeat-until-correct, speech rate/volume, next-question cue) and the same wordlist behavior.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\nList the conditions that must be met for this issue to be considered complete.  \n- [x] App speaks: “Choose the correct way of saying <word>” and then reads “A. …; B. …; C. …; D. …” in one utterance\n- [x] UI shows only A, B, C, D as tappable choices (no word text revealed)\n- [x] 1 correct answer + 3 distractors generated and shuffled each attempt\n- [x] On wrong pick: says “Try again.” and re-asks with reshuffled options for the same word\n- [x] On correct pick: says “Correct!” then “Next word.” before moving on\n- [x] Configurable speech rate, volume, and optional TTS boost/repeats\n- [x] Final score announced at the end (spoken + on-screen)\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\nHow will this be tested?  \n\n-Unit tests for distractor generation (unique, not equal to original; 3 returned)\n-Unit tests for shuffle and answer mapping (correct label resolves correctly)\n-Widget tests: tapping A–D updates state as expected; correct vs wrong flows\n-Manual tests on at least one Android and one iOS device/emulator for TTS playback, pacing, and utterance completeness\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: _e.g., 1 day  \n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [ ] Medium  \n- [x] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy  \n- [x] Moderate  \n- [ ] Hard  \n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: @Joy-Martinez \n","closed_by":{"login":"Yulio7","id":90105310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMTA1MzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90105310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7","html_url":"https://github.com/Yulio7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/221/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/221/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

🎯 Objective\nDue to a not direct and easy way for Python code to communicate with Dart code (and vice versa), a rewrite of the code, from Python to Dart, is needed as a backup in the case the currently being implemented solution, use FastAPI for them to interact with each other, is not ready in time, or any unforeseen issues arises.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nDue to how Python and Dart/Flutter works, making the UI (written in Dart) communicate with the quiz logic (written in Python) became a task with a higher difficulty and learning curve. This is because Python and Dart/Flutter internally function differently and with a lack of accessible tools that help with the communication between them rewriting the code from Python to Dart is the best option, in terms of getting a prototype ready. A solution is being developed to make the programming languages communicate with each other, however it is uncertain whether it'll be ready in time. Because of this worry, this task serves as a backup solution.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Rewrite the quiz's code from Python to Dart\n- [ ] The rewritten logic retains the same behavior with minimal compromises\n- [ ] Due to it being written in Dart, UI compatibility is available\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\nHow will this be tested?  \n- Console input test (e.g the quiz running through the console to make sure all the quiz's systems work as intended)\n- UI input test (the quiz running with the UI as the frontend)\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: 1-1.5 days  \n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [ ] Medium  \n- [x] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy  \n- [x] Moderate  \n- [ ] Hard  \n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: _@uziellopez7_  \n","closed_by":{"login":"Yulio7","id":90105310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMTA1MzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90105310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7","html_url":"https://github.com/Yulio7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/220/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/220/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

🎯 Objective\nBuild a small TTS-based multiple-choice listening quiz: given a target word (entered by the programmer for now), generate 3 vowel-swap wrong words, read out 4 options (A–D), track wrong attempts, and move to the next word when the user selects the correct option.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nCreate a command-line Python program that:\n-Accepts a target word (manual input for now; word randomizer to be added later).\n-Generates three incorrect variants by swapping vowels (configurable set: aeiou or aeiouy).\n-Shuffles the 4 options (1 correct + 3 wrongly written) and reads them via TTS (pyttsx3).\n-Prompts the user to choose A/B/C/D; counts incorrect attempts per word; repeats the same four options until correct.\n-On a correct choice, announces “Correct!”, records stats, and proceeds to the next word.\n-Prints a brief, minimal UI (letters and prompts). Option to hide the printed words while still speaking them.\n-Future scope (not in this issue): word randomizer, IPA integration, GUI.\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\nList the conditions that must be met for this issue to be considered complete.  \n- [x] Given any input word, the program produces exactly 3 vowel-swap distractors (no duplicates of the correct word).\n- [x] The four choices are randomly ordered each attempt and spoken in a single readout (A–D).\n- [x] User can answer with A/B/C/D (case-insensitive); invalid input re-prompts without crashing.\n- [x] Incorrect attempts are counted and displayed upon getting the correct answer.\n- [x] Program repeats the same question (same 4 options) until the correct answer is chosen.\n- [x] On correct, program says “Correct!” and then advances to the next word.\n- [x] Config flag to include/exclude ‘y’ as a vowel.\n\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\nHow will this be tested?  \n\n-make_distractors(word): returns 3 unique vowel-swapped strings, none equal to word.\n-assemble_options(word, distractors): returns 4 options with exactly one correct.\n-Input validator accepts only A/B/C/D; rejects others and re-prompts.\n\nManual test.\n\n-Try words with repeated vowels (e.g., “cooperate”).\n-Toggle include_y and verify behavior.\n-Simulate TTS not installed: verify text-only fallback.\n-Confirm incorrect count increments and resets on next word.\n\nUsability\n-Verify the spoken prompt is clear and not clipped; A–D are read in one utterance.\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: _e.g., 3 days / 1 week_  \n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [ ] Medium  \n- [x] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy  \n- [ ] Moderate  \n- [x] Hard  \n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: @Joy-Martinez  \n","closed_by":{"login":"Yulio7","id":90105310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMTA1MzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90105310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7","html_url":"https://github.com/Yulio7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/218/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/218/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

🎯 Objective\nCreate a new section to document behavioral patterns, tendencies, and attitudes of domain stakeholders that affect how the pronunciation coaching systems wil be used.\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nThe “Domain Engineering and Domain Facets” lecture identifies human behavior as a key facet that shapes domain processes.\nUnderstanding user behavior is crucial for designing an app that support real usage patterns rather than idealized ones.\n\nOur documentation currently captures who the stakeholders are and what they need, but not how they behave when interacting with the system or domain.\nThis section will describe the human tendencies, habits, and behavioral risks observed or assumed within the pronunciation coaching domain.\n\nIt should include:\n- Common learner behaviors (motivation loss, overconfidence, frustration)\n- Behavioral risks or biases (avoidance of feedback, overreliance on automation)\n- Implications of these behaviors for system design (e.g., reminders, gamification)\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Section 2.1.8 “Human Behavior Facet Analysis” is added\n- [ ] Includes behavioral observations of the stakeholders\n- [ ] Identifies 2–3 behavior patterns or tendencies relevant to pronunciation learning\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\n- Verify that behaviors are realistic and based in either research, observation, or reasonable assumptions\n- Check that each behavioral point connects to at least one design implication\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: 1-2 days\n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [x] Medium  \n- [ ]

🎯 Objective\nResearch and test the implementation of **OpenVoice (MyShell AI)** for voice cloning in our AI Pronunciation Coach.\nThe goal is to understand how to set up, run, and generate cloned audio samples using OpenVoice, which could later allow the app to respond to users in their own voice.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nOpenVoice is an open-source, zero-shot voice cloning model capable of generating realistic speech from short audio samples (as little as 10 seconds).\nThis issue aims to explore:\n- How to install and configure OpenVoice locally.\n- How to load the pretrained model and clone a voice sample.\n- How to generate short speech outputs for testing.\n- Evaluate performance (speed and quality) on our current environment.\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Successfully set up the OpenVoice environment \n- [ ] Successfully clone a voice from a short audio file \n- [ ] Successfully generate an audio output using cloned voice.\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\n- Install OpenVoice following official documentation\n- Clone a sample voice from a short audio file \n- Generate at least one audio output using cloned voice.\n- Document all setup steps (dependencies, commands, issues encountered).\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: 1-2 days\n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [ ] Medium  \n- [x] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy

🎯 Objective\nCreating a secure and reliable token system that automatically refreshes the Supabase session, handles token expiration and tries to maintain the session in a secure state.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nWhile Supabase handles session refresh automatically. The app still needs a way to securely store and restore these sessions in the flutter app. Users shouls remain authenticated if their session is valid and automatically logged out or re-authenticated if their token is invalid or expires. This involves:\n- Storing and managing tokens securely with flutter\n- Detecting expired and invalid tokens and logging out the user\n- Create a secure experience for the user\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Automatic token refresh will be implemented using Supabase\n- [ ] Detect expired or invalid tokens and make the user reauthenticate or log out\n- [ ] The session state should remain open and secure across app restarts\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\n- Test the token refresh logic with Supabase sessions\n- Simulate what an expired token scenario would look like and check it takes the actions needed\n- Validate session restoration after the app restarts\n- Confirm user is logged out when the refresh fails.\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: 3-4 days\n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [ ] Medium  \n- [x] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy  \n- [x] Moderate  \n- [ ] Hard  \n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: @klrskevin \n","closed_by":{"login":"Yulio7","id":90105310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMTA1MzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90105310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7","html_url":"https://github.com/Yulio7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/209/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/209/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

🎯 Objective\n\nIs to modify the quiz's logic to work with the quiz's UI.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\n\nCurrently, the quiz works as intended however the issue lies that the quiz runs in a Python Console (e.g. print() and input()). The user manually has to type either 1, 2, 3, or 4, and then press the ENTER key to confirm their answer, as well as, if they want to continue getting asked the user need to type 'y' or 'n'.\nThe goal is to make it so that the quiz takes user input from the UI (e.g. buttons) rather than using the Python Console. This also includes visually asking the user the question on screen.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] The user's inputs are given to the quiz from the UI rather than typing it in from the Python Console\n- [ ] Other quiz functions, like stopping the loop and answering the question correctly, perform the same as it does at the moment\n- [ ] Quiz is accessible from navigating the menus\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\nHow will this be tested?  \n- Run the quiz over and over again to confirm the quiz works exactly as it did, but using the UI\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: 1 day\n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [ ] Medium  \n- [x] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy  \n- [x] Moderate  \n- [ ] Hard  \n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: _@uziellopez7_  \n","closed_by":{"login":"jorge-belgo2","id":178597500,"node_id":"U_kgDOCqUufA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/178597500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2","html_url":"https://github.com/jorge-belgo2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/206/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/206/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

🎯 Objective\nFirst, implement a function named Get_Random_English_Word() (or an equivalent) which contains the code where it extracts a word from an English Dictionary (Python Library) and returns it as a string.\nSecond, update the quiz where instead of the user inputting the amount of words and what words they'd like to practice, it automatically starts the quiz with a word selected by the previously mentioned function.\nLastly, change how the answers are generated with the purpose of making it compatible with the Text-to-Speech (being developed in #161)\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nIt's required for the function to grab any word from the provided English Dictionary to be used by the quiz and TTS.\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\nList the conditions that must be met for this issue to be considered complete.  \n- [ ] The function is capable of drawing a random word from the provided English Dictionary\n- [ ] The function is able to return a string of the selected word for it to be able to be used by other components (e.g. creating erroneous answers, to be used by the TTS)\n- [ ] The quiz no longer requires the need for the user to input their own words to practice\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\nHow will this be tested?  \n- After creating the function, over and over again generate words to see the stability of the function\n- Use a WIP version of the TTS to verify if, at the very least, is able to detect a selected word\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: 1-3 days\n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [ ] Medium  \n- [x] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️

🎯 Objective\nImplement XP (Experience Points) and achievements display system in the user profile screen to visualize gamification progress and motivate continued learning. \n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\n\nThe Pronunciation Coach app currently tracks XP points and daily streaks internally (as documented in Section 2.3.2 UserProgress Component), but doesn't display achievements or detailed XP progression to users in their profile itself. \n\n***Lecture Topic Connection:***\nAccording to the \"Phenomena and Concepts\" lecture, entities can be atomic (carrying a single value) or composed (made of multiple parts).  Our current documentation identifies UserProgress as a composed entity containing:\n\n- XP points (atomic - integer)\n- Daily streak (atomic - integer)\n- Achievements (composed - list of achievement statuses)\n\n***Current Problem:***\nWhile Section 2.3.2 documents the UserProgress component's internal structure, we lack visual representation of these entities in the user interface. The lecture emphasizes that understanding whether entities are atomic or composed helps design proper data structures - but users also need to see these structures represented visually.\n\n***Proposed Solution:***\nAdd to profile screen:\n\n1. Atomic entities displayed individually:\n\n- Total XP as a prominent number\n- Current streak counter\n- Individual achievement unlock status\n\n2. Composed entities shown as structured groups:\n\n- Achievement collection showing multiple achievement entities together\n- Progress bars demonstrating composition (partial progress toward total)\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Profile screen displays total XP (atomic) and current streak (atomic)\n- [ ] At least 5 achievement badges implemented with unlock conditions\n- [ ] Achievement cards show: icon, title, and unlock status (locked/unlocked)\n- [ ] Locked achievements show progress toward unlock (e.g., \"7/30 days\")\n- [ ]  Unlocked achievements show earned date/timestamp\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\n- Verify total XP displays correctly (matches earned points)\n- Complete daily challenge and verify XP updates in profile\n- Close and reopen app, verify XP and achievements persist\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: 3 days  \n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [X] Medium  \n- [ ] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy  \n- [X] Moderate  \n- [ ] Hard  \n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: @Brzno \n","closed_by":{"login":"Yulio7","id":90105310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMTA1MzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90105310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7","html_url":"https://github.com/Yulio7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/204/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/204/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

🎯 Objective\nIntegrate the existing Flutter quiz frontend with the backend API to enable full communication between the client-side UI and the FastAPI server.  \n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nThis issue focuses on connecting the **Flutter quiz frontend** to the backend **FastAPI API endpoints** for quiz functionality.  \nThe goal is to make the frontend fully functional with live data flow, replacing mock or local logic with real API calls.\n\nWhat im building:\n- HTTP integration between Flutter quiz pages and backend endpoints (`/quiz/submit`, `/quiz/questions`, `/progress/{user_id}`)\n- Proper request/response handling with JSON decoding\n- Loading, success, and error states in the UI\n- Visual feedback for submitted answers and XP updates\n- Integration of existing quiz logic with backend validation results\n\nScope:\n✅ Connect quiz frontend to FastAPI endpoints  \n✅ Implement data models for requests and responses  \n✅ Show XP updates and quiz results dynamically  \n✅ Handle API errors and empty states gracefully  \n❌ Authentication (handled in future issue)  \n❌ Audio/ML integration (separate task)  \n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] The quiz UI fetches questions dynamically from the backend.  \n- [ ] Submitting an answer triggers a real API call and displays the returned result.  \n- [ ] XP and progress values update correctly on the frontend after a response.  \n- [ ] API failures are handled with proper error messages or fallback states.  \n- [ ] The app maintains responsive behavior and consistent UI during requests.  \n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\nHow will this be tested?  \n- Run the FastAPI backend locally and verify frontend requests reach it.  \n- Use mock users to simulate quiz sessions.  \n- Check that XP and progress are updated correctly after answering.  \n- Simulate backend downtime to verify frontend error handling.  \n- Manually test across different quiz scenarios (correct/incorrect answers).  \n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: 3 days  \n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [x] Medium  \n- [ ] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy  \n- [] Moderate  \n- [X] Hard  \n\n---\n\n##

🎯 Objective\nResearch and design a mathematically consistent method for merging quiz progress data collected while offline. Use algebraic reasoning to ensure that when data is synchronized, merges are deterministic, associative, and idempotent.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nAs the pronunciation coach app grows, users may complete quizzes offline. When they reconnect, the app must merge local and remote progress records without losing data or double-counting attempts.\nThis research task explores how to model those progress merges algebraically, ensuring predictability and correctness even under concurrency or intermittent connectivity.\n\nThe investigation should explain:\n\n-How algebraic laws (associativity, identity, commutativity, idempotence) can guarantee deterministic merges.\n\n-How to represent user progress as algebraic aggregates (e.g., using Algebras).\n\n-What known conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs) or functional approaches could be applied or simplified for this context.\n\n-A minimal prototype merge operator in Python or Dart that demonstrates the algebraic rules in practice.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n  -Clear explanation of how algebraic structures (monoid, algebras) can be used to define deterministic merge and identity operations.\n\n -Comparative overview of at least two strategies for conflict resolution (e.g., last-write-wins vs. algebraic merge).\n\n -Prototype merge implementation (in Python or Dart) demonstrating associativity and idempotence.\n\n -Unit-test plan showing how to verify algebraic properties.\n\n -Notes on feasibility and integration into the existing tracking system.\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\nBuild synthetic “offline vs. online” test datasets that simulate delayed uploads or concurrent edits.\n\nApply the merge operator in different orders to confirm deterministic outcomes.\n\nManual review of merge correctness for human-interpretable fields (e.g., total score, per-word attempts).\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: 3 days  \n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [✅] Medium  \n- [ ] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy  \n- [ ] Moderate  \n- [✅] Hard  \n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: @Adriel-bracero\n","closed_by":{"login":"jorge-belgo2","id":178597500,"node_id":"U_kgDOCqUufA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/178597500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2","html_url":"https://github.com/jorge-belgo2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/201/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/201/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

**Objective**\nAdd Section **2.2.7 Error Handling and Data Validation Requirements** to the documentation.\nThis section will define how the system handles invalid input, storage errors, or unexpected failures while ensuring that the user experience and progress tracking remain consistent.\n\n---\n\n📝 **Description**\n\nCurrently, the documentation covers the system’s main functions but lacks a clear definition of **how the system manages data errors and validation**.\nThis task will focus on:\n\n* Defining validation requirements for audio input, user IDs, and challenge data.\n* Specifying how the system should handle and display error messages.\n* Outlining recovery behavior for failed saves or network interruptions.\n* Describing internal logging and debugging standards to ensure data integrity.\n\nProposed Subsections:\n\n1. **Input Validation** – ensuring data integrity before processing.\n2. **Error Feedback** – providing meaningful, localized error messages.\n3. **Recovery Behavior** – handling storage or network errors gracefully.\n4. **Logging and Debugging** – recording errors for diagnostic purposes.\n\n---\n\n✅ **Acceptance Criteria**\n\n* Section 2.2.7 is added to the documentation following existing formatting.\n* Includes at least **4 core requirements**: validation, error handling, recovery, and logging.\n* Uses consistent structure and writing style with Sections 2.2.3–2.2.6.\n* Clearly explains how each mechanism supports system stability and user experience.\n\n---\n\n🧪 **Testing Plan**\n\n* Verify that all listed error-handling requirements are clearly stated.\n* Review formatting and consistency against previous sections.\n* Check that terminology matches system terminology (XP, streaks, pronunciation attempts, etc.).\n\n---\n\n⏱️

🎯 Objective\nSet up an environment configuration template so all developers can provide their own API keys and build the project successfully.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nCurrently, the project fails to build for users that dont have supabase setup because `lib/core/config/env.dart` is missing. This file contains critical environment variables (like Supabase URL and Anon Key) needed by `supabase_client.dart`.\n\nWe need to provide a **template** and clear instructions so developers can create their own local configuration, avoiding build errors while keeping secrets out of GitHub.\n\n**Tasks:**\n- Create `lib/core/config/env.example.dart` with placeholders for environment variables.  \n- Update `.gitignore` to exclude `env.dart`.  \n- Update `supabase_client.dart` to use `Env` for configuration.  \n- Add a `README.md` in the `config` folder explaining how to set up `env.dart`.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] `lib/core/config/env.example.dart` exists with proper placeholders.  \n- [ ] `lib/core/config/env.dart` is ignored by Git.  \n- [ ] `supabase_client.dart` compiles successfully using `Env`.  \n- [ ] `lib/core/config/README.md` provides clear setup instructions.  \n- [ ] Developers can build the project locally after creating their own `env.dart`.\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\n- Clone the repository into a fresh directory.  \n- Copy `env.example.dart` to `env.dart` and fill in valid Supabase keys.  \n- Run `flutter build` and verify there are no errors.  \n- Confirm Supabase client initializes correctly.\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: 1 day\n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [ ] Medium  \n- [x] High\n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy  \n- [x] Moderate  \n- [ ] Hard\n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: @AlexMoralesDev ","closed_by":{"login":"Yulio7","id":90105310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMTA1MzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90105310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7","html_url":"https://github.com/Yulio7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/198/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/198/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

🎯 Objective\nCreate a rule-based system that interprets extracted acoustic features and identifies the type of pronunciation error, producing structured feedback ready for the NLP model.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nThis module will analyze the acoustic features of each problematic phoneme (from the extraction module) and apply phonetic rules to identify what went wrong.\n\nExamples:\n\n- Duration Rule: If phoneme duration < 70% of native average → “too short”\n- Pitch Rule: Flat or abnormally high F0 → “intonation off”\n- Formant Rule: Distance between F1–F2 and native reference > threshold → “vowel distortion”\n- Energy Rule: Low energy + low GOP → “phoneme omitted”\n- Spectral Rule: MFCC distance indicates substitution → “sounds like /t/ instead of /θ/”\n\nThe output will be a structured JSON, e.g.:\n`{\n  \"phoneme\": \"θ\",\n  \"issue\": \"substitution\",\n  \"note\": \"sounds like /t/\"\n}`\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Accepts acoustic feature data per phoneme.\n- [ ] Applies rule-based logic to classify errors.\n- [ ] Outputs standardized JSON feedback.\n- [ ] Includes basic thresholds for duration, pitch, and MFCC distance.\n- [ ] Easily extendable for future rules.\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\n- Test with synthetic and real mispronunciations.\n- Validate rules by comparing outputs with expected human feedback.\n- Check edge cases (silence, overlapping phonemes).\n- Ensure all rules log confidence scores or thresholds used.\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: _1 week \n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [ ] Medium  \n- [ ] High

🎯 Objective\nImplement a function named RandomWordPicker() (or an equivalent) for the purposes of containing the researched information from issue #187 to be used by the already existing code for the quiz and the Text-to-Speech, being researched and developed from issues #160 & #161. At the same time use the created function to kickstart the quiz rather than, the currently implemented method, of asking the user what words they would like to quiz themselves (developed from issue #90).\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nIt's required for the function to grab any word from the provided English Dictionary to be used for the quiz and TTS as a singular string (this will replace the list of words, at the time of the creation of this issue, currently being used). Said string needs to be manipulatable by the quiz to create the erroneous answers. \n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\nList the conditions that must be met for this issue to be considered complete.  \n- [ ] The function is capable of drawing a random word from the provided English Dictionary\n- [ ] The function is able to return a string of the selected word for it to be able to be used by other components (e.g. creating erroneous answers, to be used by the TTS)\n- [ ] The quiz no longer requires the need for the user to input their own words to practice\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\nHow will this be tested?  \n- Unit tests for hand picked words\n- Run the program for a long period of time\n- Use a WIP version of the TTS to verify if, at the very least, is able to detect a selected word\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: 1-3 days\n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [ ] Medium  \n- [x] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy  \n- [x] Moderate  \n- [ ] Hard  \n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: _@uziellopez7_  \n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/188/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/188/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}

Work to include:\n\nA doc covering the lecture concepts: carrier sets, operations and closure, associativity, identity element, free monoid (event logs), and folding/interpretation. \n\nA mapping that shows how those lecture concepts apply to the quiz tracking system: event logs as free monoids, aggregates as algebraic values with merge and empty, and folding events into aggregates via a mapping. \n\nA developer spec (Python and Dart sketches) with function signatures and the algebraic laws to test (associativity and identity required).\n\nA short Python PoC that implements aggregate, merge, empty, foldEvents, and unit checks for associativity and identity.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\nMapping document showing how lecture concepts map to event folding, aggregate merging, resume and export logic. \n\n Interface spec with signatures (Python and Dart sketches) and the algebraic laws to test (associativity and identity).\n\n PoC Python script (≤ 300 lines) demonstrating foldEvents, merge, empty and unit assertions for associativity and identity.\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\nUnit tests in the PoC:\nAssociativity: merge(merge(a,b),c) == merge(a,merge(b,c)).\nIdentity: merge(a, empty()) == a == merge(empty(), a).\nFold/merge compatibility: foldEvents(events) == merge(foldEvents(chunk1), foldEvents(chunk2)).\nManual review: developer walkthrough of README and PoC.\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: 3-7 days\n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [ ] Medium  \n- [✅] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy  \n- [✅] Moderate  \n- [ ] Hard  \n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: @Adriel-bracero   \n","closed_by":{"login":"Yulio7","id":90105310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMTA1MzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90105310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7","html_url":"https://github.com/Yulio7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/184/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/184/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

Objective\n\nApply Domain Engineering principles (SE-V3:8, SE-V3:11, SE-V3:16) to identify and describe the constraints that exist within the project’s problem domain.\nThese constraints define what cannot happen or what must always hold true in the real world the system models.\n\n⸻\n\n📝 Description\n\nThis task focuses on documenting domain constraints — the fixed rules or limitations of the environment that the software must respect.\n\nExamples of domain constraints include:\n\t•\tLegal or policy restrictions (e.g., “user data must remain private”)\n\t•\tPhysical limitations (e.g., “a sensor can only capture up to 100 readings per second”)\n\t•\tLogical or business rules (e.g., “an event cannot start before the organizer confirms payment”)\n\nThe goal is to create a short, clear list of 5–7 domain constraints that shape how the system operates.\n\nAdd them as a bullet list or simple table in the documentation under a new subsection:\n\nSection 2.X.X – Domain Constraints\n\n⸻\n\n⚙️ Implementation Plan\n\t1.\tReview existing domain and requirements documentation.\n\t2.\tIdentify explicit or implicit constraints that come from the problem space (not from implementation).\n\t3.\tWrite short, clear constraint statements (1 sentence each).\n\t4.\tCommit the update to the documentation (AsciiDoc or Markdown).\n\t5.\tLink the commit or PR to this issue for manager review.\n\n⸻\n\n🔬 Testing / Verification Plan\n\t•\tTeam lead verifies that all constraints logically describe real-world limitations of the domain.\n\t•\tManager confirms that constraints are consistent with project goals and requirements.\n\n⸻\n\n✅ Deliverables\n\t•\tNew section in team documentation titled “Domain Constraints”\n\t•\tA concise list or table of 5–7 constraints clearly tied to the domain\n\n⏰ Deadline\n\nWithin 5 days of issue creation (preferably early in the milestone).\n\n⸻\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [ ] Medium  \n- [ ] High  \n\n⸻\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy

🎯 Objective\nApply the **Automata and Machines (SE - V2:11)** lecture to formalize how the application's **AI feedback engine** processes recorder user speech, evaluates their pronunciation, and returns adaptive and accurate responses. \n\nThe goal is to model this flow as a **Deterministic Finite Automation (DFA)** to improve testability, traceability, and error handling in the pronunciation quiz cycle. This task ensures that every state in the feedback process (recording, analyzing, evaluating, and responding) can be validated and reused for further architecture tasks. \n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nThe task consists of defining, modeling, and documenting the AI feedback cycle using automata concepts. \n\n**1. Conceptual Design**\n- Model the feedback process as a DFA:\n     >States: Idle, Listening, Processing, Feedback, Completed.\n     >Inputs: Audio Input, AI Score, user acknowledgement, network status.\n     >Outputs: Textual feedback, pronunciation score, transition triggers. \n\n- Define Transition Rules: what moves the automation from on state to another. \n- Handle error transitions (e.g., missing audio, API timeout → revert to Idle).\n\n     \n**2. Implementation Sketch** \n- Write a **pseudo-class or UML snippet** for a **FeedbackStateMechine** (Dart/Python)\n- Include an **onEvent(event)** method that defines the transitions. **(PDF)**\n\n**3. Visualization**\n- Create a **state diagram** (PlantUML, draw.io, or Lucidchart)\n- Show transitions like:\n\n     >Idle → Listening → Processing → Feedback → Completed → Idle\n\n**4. Research & Comparison**\n- Briefly compare deterministic vs. nondeterministic automata in AI feedback contexts.\n- Example: nondeterministic responses may arise from probabilistic AI scores; mitigate by defining acceptance thresholds.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria \n- [ ] DFA state diagram included in the research PDF \n- [ ] State table created with at least 5 states and transitions. \n- [ ] Each transition mapped to real Flutter functionality (Idle → Listening = mic widget active).\n- [ ]  Deterministic transitions confirmed (no undefined paths).\n- [ ]  Automaton traceability included in test plan (test IDs per transition).\n- [ ]  Lecture **SE - V2:11** is cited.\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\n**1. Unit Tests**\n- Simulate events triggering transitions and assert expected next states.\n- Mock AI API response to ensure ScoreReceived event transitions correctly.\n\n**2. Integration Tests**\n- Use Flutter’s integration_test package to test full cycles.\n- Validate UI updates (feedback message and next question).\n\n**3. Error Handling**\n- Simulate timeout in Processing; verify return to Idle.\n- Test invalid audio input (corrupted file).\n\n**4. Traceability**\n- Link test cases to Acceptance Criteria with IDs (e.g., AI-FSM-03).\n     \n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: 2 - 3 Days\n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [ ] Medium  \n- [ ] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy  \n- [ ] Moderate  \n- [ ] Hard  \n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: @pedroamorales  \n","closed_by":{"login":"pedroamorales","id":149693528,"node_id":"U_kgDOCOwkWA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/149693528?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedroamorales","html_url":"https://github.com/pedroamorales","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedroamorales/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedroamorales/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedroamorales/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedroamorales/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedroamorales/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedroamorales/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedroamorales/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedroamorales/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedroamorales/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/179/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/179/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

🎯 Objective\nImplement a script to automatically evaluate and compare multiple Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA) models using a gold-standard reference.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nWe need a robust evaluation pipeline that measures how well different MFA acoustic models perform when aligning the same corpus.\nThe script should:\n\n- Compare each model’s output against a manually verified gold standard (TextGrid files).\n- Compute alignment accuracy, mean absolute error (MAE), and per-phoneme error statistics.\n- Record and compare the time each model takes to align the corpus.\n- Produce a final report summarizing which model performs best across all metrics.\n\nThis tool will allow us to quantitatively determine which model yields the most accurate phoneme alignment and serves as the best baseline for further adaptation or fine-tuning.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\nList the conditions that must be met for this issue to be considered complete.  \n- [ ] Script accepts multiple model folders and a gold-standard folder as input.\n- [ ] Calculates alignment accuracy, MAE, and per-phoneme error distribution.\n- [ ] Records and reports total runtime per model.\n- [ ] Generates a final summary ranking models by accuracy and speed.\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\n- Run the script using four different MFA models on the same corpus.\n- Verify that the generated alignments match expected structure (.TextGrid files).\n- Check that the script detects missing or mismatched files gracefully.\n- Compare numerical metrics and visual outputs (phoneme-level errors) for each model.\n- Validate runtime measurements using time or system logs.\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: 3 days \n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [ ] Medium  \n- [ ] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️

🎯 Objective\n\nDevelop and validate a robust phoneme level pronunciation scoring backend using the Kaldi Goodness of Pronunciation (GOP) framework.  \nThis covers the full pipeline from environment setup to testing and evaluation forming a solid foundation.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nTo provide pronunciation evaluation beyond binary correctness, our system will integrate the Kaldi ASR toolkit with the GOP algorithm.  \nThe project involves:\n\n1. Setting up the Kaldi environment and dependencies  \n2. Configuring and validating the GOP implementation  \n3. Testing the scoring accuracy and stability with real and synthetic speech data  \n4. Normalizing and integrating the resulting scores into our backend feedback pipeline\n\nThis work enables phoneme level confidence scoring (0 - 100 scale), which is essential for providing meaningful learner feedback in our pronunciation coaching system.\n\n---\n\n## 🧩 Sub Issues\n- [#168] [Task] Set up Kaldi GOP environment and dependencies\n  Establish a working Kaldi installation and verify basic GOP functionality.  \n  (Foundation setup - includes model downloads and environment configuration)\n\n- [#169] [Feature/Task] Test Kaldi GOP scoring implementation with our dataset\n  Evaluate GOP scoring accuracy with human and AI audio samples, implement normalization, and produce comparison metrics.  \n  (Validation and integration step)\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n- Working Kaldi GOP environment successfully configured and documented  \n- GOP scoring pipeline processes dataset audio end to end  \n- Scores normalized to 0 - 100 range and integrated into feedback format  \n- Testing report comparing GOP outputs against expected human/AI benchmarks  \n- Documentation detailing setup, usage, and next steps for integration  \n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\n1.

🎯 Objective\nExpand section 3.2 “Validation and Verification” of Team 4’s documentation by adding a detailed verification plan that determines how the quiz feature will be tested and verified. This issue will be referenced by the lecture material on the topic, including lecture notes and PDFs (Phases of Software Engineering) which covered verification (\"are we doing it right?\") and the verbal expansion on validation (\"are we doing the right thing?\").\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nOur current documentation briefly mentions verification (“Unit Testing” and “Model-Checking”) but lacks a structured plan describing how the system will be verified in practice. This task expands that section by creating a verification plan specifically for the quiz feature under a new subsection 3.2.2 \"Verification Plan for Quiz Feature.”\n\nThe verification plan will:\n\n- Define verification goals and scope.\n- Provide concrete test cases with inputs, steps, and expected results.\n- Describe property-based and integration testing for randomness, timing, and error handling.\n- Note performance and robustness checks (ex. response under network loss).\n\nThis new subsection will complement section 3.2.1 \"Validation Scenarios\" by focusing on technical correctness (\"Are we doing it right?\") rather than what the stakeholders want.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n- [x] New section \"3.2.2 Verification Plan for Quiz Feature\" is added to Team 4's documentation.\n- [x] Verification techniques are consistent with the lecture’s \"testing\" phase (Triptych.pdf)\n- [x] Property-based checks cover randomization rules (4 options, 1 correct, and no duplicates).\n- [x] Integration and UI checks cover audio playback, mic permission, and feedback timing.\n- [x] Edge cases and negative tests (invalid input, duplicates, OOV words, network loss) are included.\n- [x] Performance verification (question generation and feedback <= 2-3 seconds) is noted.\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\n- Use property tests for randomization rules; integration/UI tests for audio playback, mic permissions, and pronunciation feedback; and negative tests for invalid inputs, duplicates, and network issues.\n- Run tests locally and in CI.\n- Ensure each test follows clear pass/fail criteria.\n- Ensure the plan logically complements 3.2.1 \"Validation Scenarios\".\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: 3 days\n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [x] Medium  \n- [ ] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy  \n- [x] Moderate  \n- [ ] Hard  \n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: _@iralys-sanchez18_  \n","closed_by":{"login":"Yulio7","id":90105310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMTA1MzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90105310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7","html_url":"https://github.com/Yulio7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/173/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/173/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

🎯 Objective\n\nTest Kaldi GOP scoring implementation and compare performance with our audio dataset.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\n\nWith Kaldi GOP set up, we now need to thoroughly test it with our actual dataset and implement the scoring pipeline.\n\n**Testing & Implementation Tasks:**\n- Process all test audio files (human + AI voices)\n- Implement score normalization (map GOP -10/+2 to 0-100 scale)\n- Compare GOP scores with expected results (AI vs human voices)\n- Analyze scoring accuracy and consistency\n- Create scoring output format for integration\n- Compare with other scoring methods (MFA-based approaches)\n\n**Expected Outcomes:**\n- Normalized scores for all test files\n- Performance comparison report\n- Recommendation for production use\n- Integration ready scoring format\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] All test audio files processed through GOP\n- [ ] Score normalization implemented (0-100 scale)\n- [ ] Comparison report: GOP vs expected results\n- [ ] Performance analysis completed\n- [ ] Scoring output format defined for integration\n- [ ] Recommendations documented for team\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\n\n- Process AI generated \"perfect\" pronunciation files (should score high)\n- Process human voice files with known pronunciation issues\n- Verify score distribution makes sense\n- Compare with manual evaluation where possible\n- Test score consistency across multiple runs\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\n\nEstimated completion time: 2 days\n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n\n- [ ] Low\n- [x] Medium  \n- [ ] High\n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n\n- [

🎯 Objective\nImplement a sophisticated loading screen system using advanced software design patterns specifically for replacing CircularProgressIndicator across the application, starting with login_page.dart integration.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nCreate a comprehensive loading system that integrates seamlessly with the existing login flow while providing a foundation for application-wide adoption:\n\n**Core Design Patterns to Implement:**\n\n**1. Strategy Pattern - Multiple loading behaviors:**\n\n     - PulsatingWaveLoader: Wave-like animation matching our blue theme\n\n     - ProgressStagesLoader: Multi-stage progress showing authentication steps\n \n     - MorphingShapeLoader: Shape-transforming animation\n\n     - TextTypingLoader: Animated typing effect with contextual messages\n\nImportant: We will also coordinate to use the existing `AppColors` from `colors.dart` and dynamic messaging from `AppTextStyles` and as a test our first use for the loading screens will be in `login_page.dart`\n\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n**1. Login Page Integration**\n\n- Replace current `CircularProgressIndicator` with new loading system (only for Login Page for now)\n\n- Maintain all existing form validation and authentication logic\n\n- Support dynamic messages during login process\n\n- Use existing color scheme from AppColors\n\n- Preserve responsive design with Sizer\n\n**2. Pattern Implementation**\n\n- Strategy pattern with 4+ loading behaviors\n\n- Factory pattern for easy loader creation and configuration\n\n- Observer pattern for state coordination with existing Provider\n\n- Decorator pattern for dynamic theming using AppColors\n\n**3. Loading Variants & Features**\n\n- PulsatingWaveLoader: Wave animation in primary blue theme\n\n- ProgressStagesLoader: Multi-stage progress (Validating → Authenticating → Loading Profile)\n\n- MorphingShapeLoader: Shape transitions with smooth animations\n\n- TextTypingLoader: Typewriter effect with rotating messages\n\n- Dynamic color theming using existing AppColors palette\n\n- Configurable duration and animation curves\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\n\n- Test loading displays during authentication process\n\n- Verify loading disappears on successful login\n\n- Test loading handles authentication errors gracefully\n\n- Verify loading works with existing form validation\n\n- Responsive behavior across different screen sizes\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: Approximately 3-4 days\n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [ ] Medium  \n- [ ] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy  \n- [ ] Moderate  \n- [ ] Hard  \n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: @FabianVelezOcasio \n","closed_by":{"login":"jorge-belgo2","id":178597500,"node_id":"U_kgDOCqUufA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/178597500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2","html_url":"https://github.com/jorge-belgo2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/167/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/167/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

🎯 Objective\n\nCreate very detailed sequence diagrams of the homepage that was created for Pronunciation Coach as a way to show and understand the different interactions ocurring with the methods. \n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\n\nProduce multiple sequence diagrams using PlantUML to show key interactions in the homepage, this will consist of three different sequence diagrams with different purposes:\n- The first sequence diagram focuses on the entire screen HomeScreen.build(), its purpose is so we are able to understand the screen's architecture and as a way to document and explain what was created.\n- The second sequence diagram is based on UserInfoBox.build(), its purpose is so we are able to analize the behavioral logic, and as a way to debug or even rebild any UI logic we analized.\n- The third sequence diagram is based on WelcomeBackBox.build() and its purpose is the same as the second sequence diagram, but focusing on a different method that behaves differently from the second one.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] A PlantUML file exists for each diagram\n- [ ] Each diagram accurately reflects what was explained in the description\n- [ ] Visual exports are generated for inclusion in the documentation\n- [ ] Diagrams are commited to its appropriate directory\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\n- Validate that each diagram compiles correctly in a PlantUML renderer.\n- Compare the diagrams against the code in the repository for the homepage to confirm accuracy.\n- Include rendered diagrams in project documentation for verification.\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️

🎯 Objective\nTo design an intuitive and engaging way to get the user's voice as training data.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nIf we want the voice cloning model to mimic the user's voice, we need a feature on the app to get the training data directly from the user. This feature should be optional, yet encouraged by the app, and should be engaging and not take too much time from the user. It should be optimized to gain enough data from the user to clone their voice perfectly, while also assuming that the user's pronunciation is not perfect. This issue is to provide a flowchart of the user experience when using the feature. Multiple methods will be suggested.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\nConditions that must be met.\n- [ ] Provide flowcharts with different methods that could be implemented\n- [ ] Compare each method, taking into consideration the amount of data needed.\n- [ ] Talk about different possible scenarios for different users.\n- [ ] Provide a final solution.\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\nHow will this be tested?  \n- Discussion with other team members to ensure we agree on which method(s) to use.\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: 3 days\n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [ ] Medium  \n- [ ] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy  \n- [ ] Moderate  \n- [ ] Hard  \n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: @danielReyes67  \n","closed_by":{"login":"jorge-belgo2","id":178597500,"node_id":"U_kgDOCqUufA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/178597500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2","html_url":"https://github.com/jorge-belgo2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/165/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/165/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

🎯 Objective\nImplement a local JSON Word Bank that stores words with their IPA transcription and syllables to allow the quiz to validate user input and generate answer options offline.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nThe current quiz prototype only recognizes a small test set of words defined in test.json. When a user inputs a new word, the program can't retrieve the IPA or syllables, preventing the quiz from generating properly.\n\nThis issue's objective is to create a local word bank and an access layer module that retrieves IPA and syllable data for any input word. The initial implementation will be offline, using CMUdict data through the pronouncing library to generate the bank. The structure can later allow for expansion through APIs (ex. Free Dictionary API) for missing words like proper nouns or phrases.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria \n- [x] A wordbank.json file exists and contains at least 500 entries with ipa and syllables.\n- [x] The data_access.py module can: Normalize user input (case-insensitive, remove punctuation and white spaces). Return IPA and syllables for a given word. Handle unknown words and edge-cases.\n- [x] The quiz uses the access layer instead of hard-coded test words.\n- [x] The algorithm works offline.\n- [x] The quiz runs successfully utilizing the word bank.\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan \n- Unit tests for normalization, get_ipa(), and get_syllables() using common, capitalized, and punctuated inputs. \n- Manual testing with the quiz.\n- Confirm that quiz generation runs smoothly.\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: 3 days\n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [ ] Medium  \n- [x] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy  \n- [ ] Moderate  \n- [x] Hard  \n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: _@iralys-sanchez18_  \n","closed_by":{"login":"jorge-belgo2","id":178597500,"node_id":"U_kgDOCqUufA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/178597500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2","html_url":"https://github.com/jorge-belgo2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/163/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/163/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

The options already exist; this work focuses on text-to-speech (TTS) output.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nWe need a module that:\n\n-Accepts a target word and its IPA transcription (e.g., /ˈsɔftˌwɛr/) plus three incorrect IPA options.\n-Reads aloud (TTS) the prompt\n-Confirms correctness, repeats with re-shuffled options on wrong attempts (until correct)\n\nproposed way to handle this: \n\nLanguage: Python 3.10+\nTTS engine): pyttsx3 with eSpeak NG voice (better support for phoneme/IPA-like rendering).\n\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\nList the conditions that must be met for this issue to be considered complete.  \n- [ ] The program speaks the instructions and each option, with clear “Option A/B/C/D” labels.\n- [ ] Works offline on Windows/macOS/Linux using eSpeak NG (or documented fallback). \n- [ ] Supports at least a core subset of IPA (primary stress, secondary stress, common English vowels/consonants).\n- [ ] Includes basic error handling (missing IPA, TTS not installed, empty options).\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\nUnit tests\n\nValidation: correct answer detection regardless of position.\n\nIPA sanitizer: simple mappings render without raising errors.\n\nTTS availability check (detect eSpeak NG; skip with warning if absent).\n\nEnd-to-end flow: given a word + 3 distractors, script speaks options; simulated input selects answers; flow loops on wrong, exits on correct.\n\nListen for intelligibility of stress marks and common IPA vowels (/æ ɪ ʊ ɔ ə ɝ/).\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: _e.g., 1-3 days \n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [x] Medium  \n- [ ] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy  \n- [ ] Moderate  \n- [x] Hard  \n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: @Joy-Martinez \n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/160/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/160/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}

🎯 Objective\nResearch how phenomena and concepts apply to the Pronunciation Coach app, focusing on how observable language-learning activities (speaking, feedback, correction) can be modeled as software abstractions.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nThis research task explores how the ideas from the Phenomena and Concepts lecture slides ￼can be applied to the Pronunciation Coach app domain.\n\nThings to investigate: \n\n- Phenomena are observable, real-world events — such as a learner speaking a phrase, the app recording the voice, or feedback being shown.\n- Concepts are abstractions in the software — such as User, SpeechSample, Feedback, and Score.\n\nThe goal is to create a report explaining how the app’s domain (language learning and pronunciation practice) can be structured through entities, functions, and events based on these distinctions. You’ll also compare how similar ideas appear in Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and UML, where phenomena map to events/interactions and concepts map to entities and data models.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Identify and describe at least three phenomena in the Pronunciation Coach app (e.g., speaking, listening, correction).\n- [ ] Identify and describe at least three concepts (e.g., User, Recording, Feedback).\n- [ ] Classify domain elements into entities, functions, and events/behaviors.\n- [ ] Include a short diagram or mapping showing how real-world actions (phenomena) correspond to software components (concepts).\n- [ ] Summarize how this improves the clarity of your app’s design and documentation.\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\n- Peer review the report for conceptual accuracy.\n- Ensure examples are specific to the Pronunciation Coach app.\n- Validate that the mapping between real-world activities and code elements is consistent.\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: 4 hours \n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [ ] Medium  \n- [ ] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy  \n- [ ] Moderate  \n- [ ] Hard  \n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: @alondra-arce \n","closed_by":{"login":"Fernando18Torres","id":180880125,"node_id":"U_kgDOCsgC_Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/180880125?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres","html_url":"https://github.com/Fernando18Torres","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/157/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/157/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

This task applies the Agile lecture and produces artifacts that the team can use to implement and validate PRs.\n\n--\n\n**📝 Description**\nThis task applies Agile lecture topics (INVEST, Acceptance Criteria, DoR/DoD) to standardize quality and verifiability for the Authentication module.\n\n**Work to include**\n\n1. Auth-specific DoR and DoD\n- DoR: minimal conditions to start (clarity, dependencies, risks, preliminary test criteria).\n- DoD: what must be true to close (tests pass, UI validations, error messages, CI green, evidence attached, docs updated).\n\n2. Stories & Acceptance Criteria (G/W/T)\n- Write 5–7 stories: Sign In, Sign Up, Forgot Password, Remember Me, Field Validations/Errors, optional Logout.\n- Provide 3–5 acceptance criteria per story in Given/When/Then format, including edge cases.\n\n3. Stories & Acceptance Criteria (G/W/T)\n- Evaluate each story against INVEST and propose split/refactor if not Small/Testable.\n\n4.

🎯 Objective\nCreate a functioning prototype of a word comparison algorithm made from scratch with no ai models\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nBased on previously conducted research, create a prototype for a word comparison algorithm with scoring based on how similar one word is to another. The code will analyze every phoneme in a word and compare it with its respective phoneme in another word, then it will traverse a graph in order to find the correct phoneme, and based on the path the algorithm had to take, it will determine the score, and potentially be used to provide feedback on what needs to change.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n \n- [x] Has functional code which recieves two words, and outputs a score based on the similarities between them.\n\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\nThere will be 12 different test cases. controls which are the exact same word, two words that share nothing in common, two words that are similar, and two words which are the same except for added or removed sounds\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\n1 day\n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [ ] Medium  \n- [x ] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy  \n- [ ] Moderate  \n- [x ] Hard  \n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: Uriel-D\n","closed_by":{"login":"pedroamorales","id":149693528,"node_id":"U_kgDOCOwkWA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/149693528?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedroamorales","html_url":"https://github.com/pedroamorales","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedroamorales/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedroamorales/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedroamorales/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedroamorales/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedroamorales/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedroamorales/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedroamorales/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedroamorales/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedroamorales/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/148/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/148/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

🎯 Objective\nPlan and organize the upcoming sprint focused on the user feedback module (Team #2).\nThis sprint will coordinate all steps required for generating pronunciation feedback, from the audio input to the phoneme-level evaluation and final user insights.\nIt will also outline dependencies with other teams and integrate ideas for Milestone #3, ensuring compatibility and scalability across all components.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nThis issue covers the sprint planning for the implementation of the feedback workflow.\nThe process includes multiple stages that together form the pronunciation analysis pipeline:\n\n1. Speech-to-Text (STT):\nUse Flutter dependencies to get the transcript from the user, when no reference text is provided by the user.\n\n2. Phoneme Alignment (MFA):\nUse the Montreal Forced Aligner to align the transcript and audio, producing time-aligned phonemes for further analysis.\n\n3. Acoustic Analysis:\nExtract acoustic features (e.g., MFCCs, pitch, energy) and compare them against native benchmarks to detect pronunciation deviations.\n\n4. NLP Feedback Model:\nUse the results from previous steps to generate human-readable, personalized feedback for the user — highlighting strong phonemes and suggesting improvements.\n\nThe sprint will define the division of tasks, integration points, and expected outputs from each step, ensuring all parts communicate effectively for the final feedback feature.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Sprint planning completed and documented for Team 2.\n- [ ] Clear task breakdown per stage (STT, MFA, Acoustic, NLP).\n- [ ] Identified dependencies with other teams (data format, API endpoints, etc.).\n- [ ] Established evaluation metrics (accuracy, processing time, quality of feedback).\n- [ ] Timeline and milestones approved by the team.\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\n- Validate each module independently (unit testing per stage).\n- Perform integration testing between stages to ensure smooth data flow.\n- Conduct an end-to-end test using a sample audio → ensure feedback is generated correctly.\n- Evaluate timing and performance of the pipeline under realistic conditions.\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: _e.g., 3 days / 1 week_  \n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [ ] Medium  \n- [ ] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy  \n- [ ] Moderate  \n- [ ] Hard  \n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: @JorgeLuisMaya \n","closed_by":{"login":"jorge-belgo2","id":178597500,"node_id":"U_kgDOCqUufA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/178597500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2","html_url":"https://github.com/jorge-belgo2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/146/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/146/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

🎯 Objective\nAnalyze how the concepts presented in the Domain Engineering and Domain Facets lecture apply to the backend implementation of the Pronunciation Coach application and add a “Domain Engineering Integration” section to document how these concepts are reflected within the project.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\n- This  issue focuses on establishing a clear relationship between the theoretical framework of Domain Engineering and Domain Facets and the practical backend structure being developed. The presentation highlights how domain understanding should drive system design through facets. By analyzing how these principles map to the current backend implementation, we can ensure our architecture accurately represents the pronunciation learning process and supports consistent progress analytics and other necessities.\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\nList the conditions that must be met for this issue to be considered complete.  \n- [ ] Section 2.3.4 \"Domain Engineering Integration\" is added to Team 3 Documentation\n- [ ] The main principles from the Domain Engineering and Domain Facets lecture are summarized clearly.\n- [ ] The planned backend architecture (Supabase + xAPI) is outlined in relation to these domain engineering principles.\n \n--- \n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time:  1 day\n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [ ] Medium  \n- [ ] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy  \n- [ ] Moderate  \n- [ ] Hard  \n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: @ivxnmorxles  \n","closed_by":{"login":"jorge-belgo2","id":178597500,"node_id":"U_kgDOCqUufA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/178597500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2","html_url":"https://github.com/jorge-belgo2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/140/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/140/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

Objective**\nMake the “Sign In” button functional so users can log in with their email and password.\nOnce valid credentials are entered, the user should be navigated to the UserProgressDashboard.\nIf credentials are incorrect, display an error message and allow the user to try again.\n\n**📝 Description**\nCurrently, the LoginPage UI exists but the buttons are non-functional.\nThis task will implement the login logic and connect the “Sign In” button to a basic authentication system.\n\nThe system should:\n- Validate that the email is in a correct format and the password is not empty.\n- Disable the “Sign In” button while the login request is processing.\n- On successful authentication, navigate to the UserProgressDashboard.\n- On invalid credentials, show an error message using a SnackBar or Dialog.\n\n**✅ Acceptance Criteria**\n- The “Sign In” button remains disabled until valid email and password are entered.\n- Pressing “Sign In” triggers authentication and disables the button during loading.\n- On success, the user is redirected to UserProgressDashboard.\n- On incorrect credentials, an error message appears and the user can retry.\n- Simple unit tests exist for email validation and mock authentication.\n\n**🧪 Testing Plan**\nManual testing:\n- Enter valid credentials (test@demo.com / 123456) → Expect navigation to dashboard.\n- Enter invalid credentials → Expect error message.\n- Try pressing “Sign In” multiple times quickly → Only one request should trigger.\n\nUnit testing:\n- Test valid and invalid email patterns.\n- Test success/failure from mock authentication service.\n\n**⏱️ Timeframe**\nEstimated completion time: 6–8 hours.\n\n**⚡ Urgency**\nHigh — This feature enables the main login flow for the app.\n\n**🎚️ Difficulty**\nModerate — Requires form validation, async state handling, and navigation logic.\n\n**👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer**\n@aryam-diaz — currently working on the LoginPage branch and familiar with its structure.","closed_by":{"login":"pedroamorales","id":149693528,"node_id":"U_kgDOCOwkWA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/149693528?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedroamorales","html_url":"https://github.com/pedroamorales","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedroamorales/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedroamorales/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedroamorales/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedroamorales/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedroamorales/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedroamorales/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedroamorales/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedroamorales/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedroamorales/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/137/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/137/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

🎯 Objective\nExpand section 3.2 \"Validation and Verification\" of Team 4's documentation by adding concrete stakeholder validation scenarios, directly applying lecture concepts on validation. This issue will be referenced by the lecture material on the topic, including lecture notes and PDFs (Phases of Software Engineering) which covered verification (\"are we doing it right?\") and the verbal expansion on validation (\"are we doing the right thing?\").\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nValidation requires involvement of stakeholders and works best through inspectable scenarios rather than abstract requirements. Our documentation already contains a “Validation and Verification” section, but it currently describes these concepts in general terms. This task adds 2–3 scenario-based walkthroughs to the documentation under a new section 3.2.1 \"Validation Scenarios.”\n\nEach scenario will include:\n\n- The goal from the stakeholder's perspective.\n- Preconditions for the scenario.\n- Main flow (step-by-step interaction).\n- Edge cases / alternative flows.\n- Observable outcomes that can be judged by non-developers.\n- Clear acceptance criteria.\n\nBy expanding this section, we will align more closely with the lecture’s emphasis on validation, provide documentation that stakeholders can use to review the system, and strengthen our milestone submissions with concrete examples of how requirements are tested in practice.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria \n- [x] New section \"3.2.1 Validation Scenarios\" is added in the Team 4 documentation. \n- [x] At least 2 validation scenarios are fully documented in the section 3.2.1 \"Validation Scenarios.”\n- [x] Scenarios clearly follow lecture material (stakeholder-focused, concrete, inspectable).\n- [x] Each scenario includes goal, preconditions, flow, outcomes, and acceptance criteria.\n- [x] Each scenario is phrased so a non-developer stakeholder could understand and review it without technical knowledge.\n- [x] Acceptance criteria inside each scenario are measurable and objective.\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan \n- At least one teammate poses as a stakeholder and reviews each scenario for clarity.\n- Confirm that verification is still covered under testing (unit tests, model checking, etc.) while validation is explicitly represented with stakeholder scenarios, as described in class.\n- Ensure scenarios are understandable without developer knowledge.\n- Verify scenarios are consistent with existing requirements and features.\n- Check that acceptance criteria are measurable and testable.\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: 3 days\n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [x] Medium  \n- [ ] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy  \n- [x] Moderate  \n- [ ] Hard  \n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: _@iralys-sanchez18_  \n","closed_by":{"login":"jorge-belgo2","id":178597500,"node_id":"U_kgDOCqUufA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/178597500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2","html_url":"https://github.com/jorge-belgo2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/130/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/130/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

🎯 Objective\n\nGoal: Create a proper, implementation-ready statechart diagram that models the internal logic flow of the Quiz Progress Tracking and Report feature. The statechart shall be based on the class lecture material (Statecharts PDF) and be detailed enough to implement the behavior later.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nThis task applies the Statecharts lecture material to produce a complete statechart that governs the quiz progress tracking and reporting flow. Deliverables must include a clear diagram plus an implementation-ready specification.\n\nWork to include:\nReview the lecture PDF (Statecharts lecture notes) and apply the relevant concepts (hierarchical states, transitions, guards/conditions, entry/exit actions, history states, orthogonal regions) to the quiz progress domain. \n\nProduce a visual statechart diagram that models the full quiz progress tracking flow, including session lifecycle, per-question states, recording/evaluation states, summary/export flow, error handling, and any parallel regions needed (e.g., network state). The diagram should follow standard statechart notation taught in the lecture. \n\nProduce a developer specification (markdown) that enumerates: states, events, transitions, guards/conditions, entry/exit actions, and history semantics. This spec must map each element back to the lecture concepts so reviewers can verify correctness. \n\nInclude implementation notes for Flutter/Dart: recommended state-machine library (or pattern), suggested file/module boundaries, and a short code sketch showing how to wire the statechart to UI events and persistence.\n\nProvide small example scenarios (at least 3) traced through the statechart (e.g., normal session finish → export success, interrupted session + resume, export failure + retry) so reviewers can follow behavior end-to-end.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\nA visual statechart diagram representing the full quiz progress tracking logic. The diagram must be clear, use standard statechart notation, and be checked against lecture concepts. \n\n A developer specification (MARKDOWN) that enumerates: top-level and nested states, events, transitions, guards, entry/exit actions, history semantics, and any orthogonal regions. Each item in the spec must include a 1–2 sentence rationale and link back to the lecture concept where appropriate. \n\n At least three worked scenarios traced through the statechart (text traces showing the sequence of events and resulting states), including normal and edge cases (resume after interruption, export failure + retry, low STT confidence handling).\n\n Implementation notes for Flutter/Dart that recommend an approach (state-machine library or pattern), show a minimal wiring sketch (pseudo-code or short Dart snippet), and list which UI components / modules the statechart will control.\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\nTraceability check: each major state/transition must point back to a lecture concept (hierarchy, guard, entry/exit)  \n\nScenario walkthroughs: run through the three provided scenarios and verify that the state transitions and actions are correct and cover edge cases.\n\nImplementation readiness check: The implementation notes and wiring sketch must be sufficient in order for the logic flow to be properly implemented in the actual code.\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time:  2-3 days   \n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [ ] Medium  \n- [✅] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy  \n- [ ] Moderate  \n- [✅] Hard  \n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: @Adriel-Bracero  \n","closed_by":{"login":"Yulio7","id":90105310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMTA1MzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90105310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7","html_url":"https://github.com/Yulio7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/123/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/123/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

🎯 Objective\n\nCreate a new Section 2.1.8 \"Stakeholder Perspectives Analysis\" for Team 2 documentation following domain engineering principles to document how different stakeholders view the pronunciation coaching domain differently.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\n\n**Lecture Connection:** The \"Domain Engineering and Domain Facets\" lecture emphasizes that different stakeholder groups have distinct perspectives on the same domain concepts. Understanding these differences is crucial for designing systems that meet diverse user needs.\n\n**Current Gap:** Our documentation currently treats all users as \"learners\" without acknowledging how perspectives might differ between:\n- University students vs. working professionals\n- Self learners vs. institution supported\n- Technical vs. non technical users\n- Different native language backgrounds\n\n**What to Document:**\n- Map how key domain concepts (pronunciation feedback, progress tracking, error detection) are perceived differently across stakeholder groups\n- Identify potential conflicts or inconsistencies in stakeholder requirements\n- Document how these perspective differences should influence system design decisions\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] New Section 2.1.8 created with clear stakeholder group definitions\n- [ ] Analysis of at least 3 distinct stakeholder perspectives on 4 key domain concepts\n- [ ] Identification of 2-3 potential requirement conflicts between stakeholder groups\n- [ ] Clear recommendations for handling perspective differences in system design\n- [ ] References to relevant persona data from Section 2.2.2\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\n\n- Verify each stakeholder perspective is grounded in actual user research or persona data\n- Check that perspective differences are meaningful and impact system requirements\n- Ensure conflict resolutions are practical and implementable\n- Validate that analysis connects back to existing domain terminology\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\n\nEstimated completion time: 2-3 days\n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n\n- [ ] Low\n- [x] Medium  \n- [ ] High\n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n\n- [ ] Easy\n- [x] Moderate\n- [ ] Hard\n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\n\nSuggested developer: _@jose-valentin_","closed_by":{"login":"Fernando18Torres","id":180880125,"node_id":"U_kgDOCsgC_Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/180880125?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres","html_url":"https://github.com/Fernando18Torres","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/122/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/122/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

🎯 Objective\n\nAdd Section 2.2.6 **Function Signatures and Specifications** to the documentation. This section will formally define the main system functions with clear input/output signatures and high-level specifications, clarifying *what* each function does (not *how*).\n\n---\n\n### 📝 Description\n\nCurrently, the documentation includes **Domain Functions** (Section 2.1.5) but lacks a formal description of the **System Requirements Functions**.\nThis task will focus on:\n\n1. Creating 5–6 formal function signatures with input/output types.\n2. Writing clear specifications for each function.\n3. Ensuring consistency with the style of *Phenomena and Concepts*.\n4. Providing examples aligned with the domain (pronunciation, streak, XP, challenges).\n\nProposed functions:\n\n* `assessPronunciation: AudioRecording → PronunciationModel → AccuracyScore`\n* `updateStreak: UserID → Date → StreakStatus`\n* `calculateXP: ChallengeCompleted → DifficultyLevel → XPPoints`\n* `selectChallenge: UserSkillLevel → AvailablePhrases → PronunciationChallenge`\n* `persistProgress: UserProgress → StorageStatus`\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n* Section **2.2.6 Function Signatures and Specifications** is created in the documentation.\n* At least 5 core system functions are documented with input/output types.\n* Each function has a **formal specification** that explains the requirement.\n* The section follows the same formatting style as existing documentation (e.g., Sections 2.1.x and 2.2.x).\n* Examples are relevant to the pronunciation training context.\n\n---\n\n### 🧪 Testing Plan\n\n* Review the section to confirm all functions are defined with input/output and specification.\n* Check consistency of style and formatting against Section 2.1.5.\n* Validate that functions align with system requirements and not implementation details.\n\n---\n\n### ⏱️ Timeframe\n\nEstimated completion time: **2–3 days**\n\n---\n\n### ⚡ Urgency\n\n- [ ] Low\n-  [ ] Medium \n-  [ ] High\n\n---\n\n### 🎚️ Difficulty\n\n - [ ] Easy\n - [ ] Moderate \n - [ ] Hard\n\n---\n\n### 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\n\nSuggested developer: @EnriqueVilela2714 \n","closed_by":{"login":"jorge-belgo2","id":178597500,"node_id":"U_kgDOCqUufA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/178597500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2","html_url":"https://github.com/jorge-belgo2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/120/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/120/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

🎯 Objective\nRefactor LearningPace implementation to follow algebraic design principles, ensuring all operations are closed under the carrier set.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nCurrently, the LearningPace enum and its associated operations don't follow algebraic design principles as described in the Software Engineering course materials (Algebras lecture).\n**Background:** An algebra consists of:\n\n- A carrier set (our LearningPace enum values)\n- A finite set of operations that are closed (take elements from the set and return elements from the same set)\n\n**Current Issues:**\n\n- Operations are scattered across multiple files\n- No explicit algebraic operations like next(), previous(), or default()\n- setPace() modifies global state instead of working with pure values\n- Missing self-contained operations that would make the type more maintainable\n\n**References:**\n\n- Lecture: Algebras (September 11, 2020) - Section \"how do they relate to software engineering?\"\n- Key principle: \"concepts and operations easier to understand if self-contained\"\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n-  [ ] LearningPace enum has a static defaultPace getter returning LearningPace.casual\n-  [ ] next() method implemented (casual→standard→intensive→intensive)\n-  [ ] previous() method implemented (casual→casual, standard→casual, intensive→standard)\n-  [ ] minutes getter returns appropriate Int values (5, 15, 30)\n-  [ ] Helper getters added: displayName, subtitle, icon\n-  [ ] MyAppState uses algebraic operations (incrementPace(), decrementPace())\n-  [ ] All operations maintain closure (stay within LearningPace set)\n-  [ ] Code includes comments documenting the algebra structure\n-  [ ] Existing functionality preserved (persistence, UI selection)\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\nUnit Tests:\n\n- Test next() boundary: intensive.next() == intensive\n- Test previous() boundary: casual.previous() == casual\n- Test defaultPace returns casual\n- Test minutes returns correct values for each pace\n\nIntegration Tests:\n\n- Verify incrementPace() cycles through paces correctly\n- Verify decrementPace() cycles through paces correctly\n- Verify persistence still works after refactor\n\nManual Testing:\n\n- Test UI pace selection\n- Test increment/decrement buttons (if added)\n- Verify SharedPreferences still saves/loads correctly\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion 2 - 3 days  \n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [X] Medium  \n- [ ] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy  \n- [X] Moderate  \n- [

🎯 Objective\nCreate a new Section 2.1.8 \"Domain Phenomena vs. Concepts Classification\" for the documentation of team 3, following the \"Phenomena and Concepts\" lecture guidelines to clearly distinguish between observable instances and abstract concepts in our domain.\n\n## 📝 Description\n**Lecture Connection:** The \"Phenomena and Concepts\" lecture explains the distinction between phenomena (observable, concrete instances that can be sensed or measured) and concepts (abstractions, classes, types). This distinction helps our team and the teams in general to avoid confusion between actual runtime instances and the classes/types that describe them.\n\n**Current Gap:** Our domain description sometimes mixes specific instances with general types — for example, \"Language Learner\" might refer to Maria (a phenomenon) or the learner category (a concept). Clarifying these distinctions will make our design and data structures more precise.\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n-  [ ] New Section 2.1.8 created with clear formatting\n- [ ] Simple table with minimum 6 domain elements showing phenomenon vs. concept examples\n- [ ] List of 5-6 entities marked as atomic or composed\n- [ ] For composed entities, list their component parts\n- [ ] Written in clear, simple language without the use of any technical words.\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\n\n- Each phenomenon example should be something that could exist in a running system.\n- Each concept example should represent an abstraction or type.\n- Atomic/composed classifications must match expected data structure designs.\n- Section should make Section 2.1.4 entities easier to interpret.\n\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: 1-2 days\n\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [x] Medium  \n- [ ] High  \n\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy  \n- [x] Moderate  \n- [ ] Hard  \n\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: @Brzno \n","closed_by":{"login":"jorge-belgo2","id":178597500,"node_id":"U_kgDOCqUufA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/178597500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2","html_url":"https://github.com/jorge-belgo2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/114/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/114/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

🎯 Objective\nRevise Section 2.1 of Team 3 documentation to follow Triptych lecture principles - domain should describe \"as-is\" situation only, with no references to \"the system.\"\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\n**Lecture Connection:** Applies \"Phases of Software Engineering\" Triptych lecture - specifically the Domain Description phase which must describe the current situation without referencing the system-to-be.\n\n### What to Fix:\nOur current Section 2.1.5 (Domain Functions) describes what \"the system\" does instead of what happens in the domain naturally. According to the lecture, domain functions should describe domain operations, not system operations.\n\n**Example of what's wrong:**\n```\nassessPronunciation : PronunciationAttempt × PronunciationModel → AccuracyScore\nDescription: Compares learner's pronunciation attempt against native speaker model...\n```\n\nThis describes a system function. It should describe what happens in the domain (like a tutor evaluating a student).\n\n### What to Do:\n1. Rewrite Section 2.1.5 - change functions to describe domain activities (tutors, learners, practice sessions) not system operations\n2. Add Section 2.1.7 - document one pronunciation practice behavior as a sequence of events and actions\n3. Remove any \"the system\" references from all of Section 2.1\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Section 2.1.5 rewritten with domain functions (no \"system\" references)\n- [ ] New Section 2.1.7 added with at least one behavior sequence\n- [ ] Zero instances of \"the system\" in Section 2.1.1 through 2.1.7\n- [ ] All changes highlighted in yellow in the document\n- [ ] Includes note citing Triptych lecture at end of Section 2.1\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\n- Search document for \"the system\" in Section 2.1 - should find zero\n- Have peer review to catch any system-to-be references\n- Manager verifies clear separation from Section 2.2 (Requirements)\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: 3 days\n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [x] Medium  \n- [ ] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy  \n- [X] Moderate  \n- [ ] Hard  \n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: @AlexMoralesDev \n\n","closed_by":{"login":"jorge-belgo2","id":178597500,"node_id":"U_kgDOCqUufA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/178597500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2","html_url":"https://github.com/jorge-belgo2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/110/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/110/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

🎯 Objective\n\nResearch and design a pronunciation scoring method using Forced Alignment (MFA) and Posterior Probabilities to evaluate user speech accuracy.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\n\nTo go beyond binary correct/incorrect pronunciation detection, we need a way to measure the chances that a phoneme was produced correctly. This method uses the teams existing MFA backbone:\n\n- MFA Forced Alignment: provides phoneme boundaries and timestamps.\n- Posterior Probabilities : provides confidence per phoneme\n\nTasks:\n- Research how MFA outputs can be paired with posterior probabilities.\n- Identify whether probabilities can be extracted directly from MFA or if an additional ASR backend is needed.\n- Define a scoring function (normalize probabilities into a usable scale, like 0–1 or 0–100.\n- Document pros/cons of this method compared to simple phoneme mismatch detection.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Documentation on how to extract posterior probabilities in the MFA/ASR pipeline.\n- [ ] A proposed scoring method for per-phoneme pronunciation evaluation.\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\n\n- Extract posterior probabilities and compare scores for correctly vs incorrectly pronounced words.\n- Evaluate if scores correlate with human judgment.\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\n\nEstimated completion time: 2–3 days\n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n\n- [ ] Low\n- [x] Medium\n- [ ] High\n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n\n- [ ] Easy\n- [x] Moderate\n- [ ] Hard\n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\n\nSuggested developer: _@jose-valentin_","closed_by":{"login":"Yulio7","id":90105310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMTA1MzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90105310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7","html_url":"https://github.com/Yulio7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/104/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/104/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

Objective\nGoal: Implement session summary and per-word progress tracking state machine so learners and researchers can see performance (accuracy, attempts, common errors) after a quiz session and across sessions.\n\n📝 Description\n\nThis task is a lightweight local analytics backend concept for the pronunciation-quiz flow. During a practice session the app will record events (word ID, timestamp, result, attempts, STT/confidence, hint used). At session end the UI will present a concise summary (overall accuracy, per-word accuracy, words needing practice, attempts distribution). The app will also persist aggregated per-word statistics across sessions so users can track progress over time, and the team can export session data as CSV for offline analysis.\n\nDeliverables:\nA Flutter session-summary screen and end-of-session flow.\nA local storage schema for per-session and per-word aggregates (suggest sqflite or hive).\nExportable CSV of session results and per-word aggregates.\nUnit tests and simple integration tests for metrics calculations.\nData / event examples (for developers):\n\n\n✅ Acceptance Criteria\n End-of-session summary screen implemented in Flutter that shows: overall accuracy, total attempts, average STT confidence, and list of words needing practice (by lowest accuracy).\n\n Per-word aggregate data stored locally (fields include word_id, times_practiced, correct_count, total_attempts, last_practiced, avg_stt_confidence).\n\n Session-level raw events saved for each session (so exports can reproduce session timeline).\n\n Export feature that writes a CSV with session events and a separate CSV for per-word aggregates. Export must produce files accessible to the user (or QA) on the device.\n\n Unit tests that validate metric calculations (accuracy, attempt counts, aggregation).\n\n\n\n🧪 Testing Plan\n\nUnit tests for aggregator functions (given synthetic event lists, compute accuracy and aggregates).\n\nIntegration test: run a simulated session of 10 questions (mix correct/incorrect), verify stored session events and computed aggregates match expected values.\n\nManual QA: run a real session on device/emulator, open session summary, export CSV, and inspect that the CSV contains expected rows and columns and that per-word stats persist across app restarts.\n\nEdge cases to test: multiple attempts per word, very low STT confidence (should be reflected), resumed sessions (partial sessions persisted), export on devices with limited storage, and empty-session behavior.\n\n\n⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: 3 days / 1 week\n\n⚡ Urgency\n Low\nMedium\n[✅] High\n\n\n🎚️ Difficulty\n[ ] Easy  \n[ ] Moderate  \n[✅] Hard  \n\n\n\n👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: @Adriel-bracero \n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/103/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/103/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}

🎯 Objective\nCreate a visually appealing login page UI that serves as the entry point to the application, with a temporary testing mechanism to bypass authentication during development.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nWe need to implement a login page UI that will be the first screen users see when opening the application. The page should follow modern design principles and maintain consistency with the existing application theme. Since this is during a phase where this screen will appear first, the implementation should include a way to bypass the login and access the main application without full authentication functionality.\n\nDesign Requirements:\n\n- Clean, modern interface with gradient background\n\n- Email and password input fields\n\n- Remember me checkbox and forgot password link\n\n- Primary login button and secondary testing bypass button\n\n- Sign up prompt for new users\n\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n- Login page loads as the initial route when app starts\n- UI matches the provided design specifications\n- All form fields are properly styled and functional\n- \"Skip Login (Testing)\" button navigates to the Main Page\n- Main \"Sign In\" button has placeholder functionality\n- Color scheme and text styles are consistent with existing app constants\n- Page is responsive and works correctly in other extension\n- No console errors or warnings\n- Code follows Dart/Flutter best practices\n\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\n\nManual Testing:\n\n- Verify login page appears on app startup\n- Test text field interactions and validation\n- Confirm \"Skip Login\" button navigates to dashboard\n- Verify \"Sign In\" button shows intended behavior (placeholder)\n- Check responsiveness on different screen sizes\n- Validate color and typography consistency\n\nExtension Testing:\n\n- Test login page renders correctly in extension popup\n- Verify all interactive elements work in extension context\n- Check for any extension-specific layout issues\n\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: 1-3 days \n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [ ] Medium  \n- [x] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy  \n- [x] Moderate  \n- [ ] Hard  \n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: @FabianVelezOcasio  \n","closed_by":{"login":"Yulio7","id":90105310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMTA1MzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90105310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7","html_url":"https://github.com/Yulio7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/98/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/98/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

🎯 Objective\nEvaluate the performance of the Whisper speech recognition model and upload the results in a structured format, so we can directly compare it with other models under consideration.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nWe want to benchmark the Whisper model against alternative ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) systems by running it on a controlled dataset of approximately 100 audio samples. The decision will be base on:\n\n- Accuracy (percentage of correct transcriptions, WER)\n- Latency (time taken to transcribe each audio)\n- Resource usage (space, CPU/GPU, memory)\n- Once the evaluation is complete, we will upload the results (e.g., as a CSV file) containing all relevant metrics for each audio sample. This will allow us to visualize and compare performance across models in a standardized way.\n\n## This issue ensures that we establish a clear baseline for Whisper's performance, which will guide future decisions regarding whether to integrate or replace it with other ASR solutions.\n\n---\n\n✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n[] At least 100 audio samples tested across all implementations.\n\n[] Output a csv file with all the necessary data we need to compare it with the others models.\n\n---\n\n🧪 Testing Plan\nHow will this be tested?\n\n- Run the Whisper model on the prepared dataset of ~100 audio samples.\n- Collect transcriptions and compare them against ground-truth transcripts using WER.\n- Measure latency per file and record system resource consumption during processing.\n- Store all results in a CSV file.\n- Verify that the results are complete, accurate, and in the expected format for future comparison.\n\n---\n\n⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: 2 days\n\n---\n\n⚡ Urgency\n\n[] Low\n[] Medium\n[] High\n\n---\n\n🎚️ Difficulty\n\n[] Easy\n[] Moderate\n[] Hard\n\n---\n\n👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: @danielReyes67 ","closed_by":{"login":"jorge-belgo2","id":178597500,"node_id":"U_kgDOCqUufA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/178597500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2","html_url":"https://github.com/jorge-belgo2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/95/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/95/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

🎯 Objective\nBuild a rule-based word categorizer that returns a difficulty level (Easy / Intermediate / Hard) from a word’s phoneme sequence.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nBuild a small Python module that categorizes a word’s difficulty from its phoneme sequence. On input, normalize the word, obtain phonemes via the existing splitter (phonemizer) to one alphabet (IPA or ARPABET), compute transparent features (rare-phoneme ratio, consonant clusters, syllables, stress/length heuristics), and map a weighted score to a level using config-driven thresholds. Return a simple, lightweight word profile and handle out-of-vocabulary cases. This algorithm will later be used to seed the word bank.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n- [x] Uses one phoneme alphabet consistently and documents it.\n- [x] Word profile at least includes word, phones, features, score, and level.\n- [x] Features includes at least: rare phone ratio, cluster count, syllables, stress complexity, length penalty (constants configurable).\n- [x] Scoring is a weighted sum with config-driven thresholds that maps to one of the three levels (Easy, Intermediate, Hard).\n- [x] Handles edge-cases for out of vocabulary/unknown words.\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\nHow will this be tested?  \n- Manual input testing.\n- Perform unit tests for mapping, normalization, feature presence, edge cases, etc.\n- Perform property tests to ensure that the same input returns the same output.\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: 4 days\n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [x] Medium  \n- [ ] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy  \n- [ ] Moderate  \n- [x] Hard  \n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: _@iralys-sanchez18_  \n","closed_by":{"login":"Fernando18Torres","id":180880125,"node_id":"U_kgDOCsgC_Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/180880125?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres","html_url":"https://github.com/Fernando18Torres","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/93/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/93/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

🎯 Objective\nEvaluate the performance of the Vosk speech recognition model and upload the results in a structured format, so we can directly compare it with other models under consideration.\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nWe want to benchmark the Vosk model against alternative ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) systems by running it on a controlled dataset of approximately 100 audio samples. The decision will be base on:\n- Accuracy (percentage of correct transcriptions, WER)\n- Latency (time taken to transcribe each audio)\n- Resource usage (space, CPU/GPU, memory)\nOnce the evaluation is complete, we will upload the results (e.g., as a CSV file) containing all relevant metrics for each audio sample. This will allow us to visualize and compare performance across models in a standardized way.\n\nThis issue ensures that we establish a clear baseline for Vosk’s performance, which will guide future decisions regarding whether to integrate or replace it with other ASR solutions.\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\nList the conditions that must be met for this issue to be considered complete.  \n- [ ] At least 100 audio samples tested across all implementations.\n- [ ] Output a csv file with all the necessary data we need to compare it with the others models.\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\nHow will this be tested?  \n- Run the Vosk model on the prepared dataset of ~100 audio samples.\n- Collect transcriptions and compare them against ground-truth transcripts using WER.\n- Measure latency per file and record system resource consumption during processing.\n- Store all results in a CSV file.\n- Verify that the results are complete, accurate, and in the expected format for future comparison.\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: 2 days\n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [ ] Medium  \n- [ ] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy  \n- [ ] Moderate  \n- [ ] Hard  \n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: @JorgeLuisMaya \n","closed_by":{"login":"jorge-belgo2","id":178597500,"node_id":"U_kgDOCqUufA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/178597500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2","html_url":"https://github.com/jorge-belgo2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/92/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/92/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

🎯 Objective\nClearly state the goal of this issue.  \nCreate the main starting point of the quiz. The system should prompt users to input how many words they would like to practice and then allow them to enter those words.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nThe quiz should begin by asking users how many words they want to practice. After providing a number, the system will request the specific words from the user. If a word is repeated or does not exist in the dictionary, the system should prompt the user to re-enter a valid word. This ensures that only unique and valid words are accepted before starting the practice session. This will use the already existing dictionary word checker code team 4 has.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\nList the conditions that must be met for this issue to be considered complete.  \n- [x] User is prompted to enter how many words they want to practice and user can input the chosen number of words.\n- [x] System validates each word against the dictionary and If a word is invalid (not in dictionary), user is asked to re-enter it.\n- [x] If a word is repeated, user is asked to re-enter it.\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\nHow will this be tested?  \n\nEnter a valid set of words and confirm the quiz starts properly.\nEnter a repeated word and check that the system requires re-entry.\nEnter a non-existent word and check that the system requires re-entry.\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: _e.g., 3 days _  \n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [ ] Medium  \n- [x] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy  \n- [ ] Moderate  \n- [x] Hard  \n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer - Team 4 dev -\nSuggested developer: \n \n","closed_by":{"login":"Yulio7","id":90105310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMTA1MzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90105310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7","html_url":"https://github.com/Yulio7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/90/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/90/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

🎯 Objective\nResearch and brainstorm the flow and usability aspects of the login screen (Inicio de Sesión), focusing on user journey, error handling, accessibility, and security from a UX perspective.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nWe need to research and brainstorm how users experience the login process from the entry point to dashboard access. This includes mapping the user journey, defining error handling and recovery strategies, ensuring accessibility and inclusivity, and balancing usability with security features (e.g., “remember me,” 2FA, lockouts). The goal is to provide insights that guide a smooth, accessible, and secure login flow in Flutter.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\nResearch Deliverables:\n•\tDefine user journey (entry point → login → dashboard).\n•\tBrainstorm ideas to keep login accessible within 1–2 clicks with clear CTAs.\n•\tDocument error handling & recovery (invalid login messages, forgot password, brute-force prevention).\n•\tBrainstorm inline guidance for reducing user frustration (e.g., Caps Lock warnings).\n•\tDocument accessibility & inclusivity measures (keyboard navigation, screen reader labels, error announcements, password visibility toggle).\n•\tBrainstorm ideas for color/contrast accessibility.\n•\tDefine security UX features (remember me, seamless 2FA, account lockouts, “trust this device”).\n•\tSummarize findings into a single document with a balance of flow, accessibility, and security.\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\nSince this is a research/brainstorming issue, validation will be through review, not code testing:\n•\tPeer review of research findings.\n•\tTeam feedback on user journey flow and accessibility strategies.\n•\tCross-check with accessibility guidelines (WCAG).\n•\tEnsure security measures don’t compromise usability.\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: 1 week\n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [x] Medium  \n- [ ] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy  \n- [x] Moderate  \n- [ ] Hard  \n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested researcher: @kevinlara1 \n","closed_by":{"login":"jorge-belgo2","id":178597500,"node_id":"U_kgDOCqUufA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/178597500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2","html_url":"https://github.com/jorge-belgo2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/72/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/72/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

🎯 Objective\n\nTo research and document how Out of Vocabulary (OOV) words can be handled in the Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA). The focus is on leveraging MFA’s built in Grapheme to Phoneme (G2P) system, exploring alternatives and recommending the most practical approach for English and Spanish.\n\n---\n\n# 📝 Description\n\nMFA relies on phonetic dictionaries to align text with audio. However, when OOV words appear (names, slang, uncommon words), MFA cannot align them unless phonetic transcriptions are generated. This issue will:\n\n- Investigate how MFA’s built in G2P handles OOV words in English and Spanish.\n- Summarize alternative approaches.\n- Document why MFA’s integrated G2P is likely the most suitable choice for our project.\n- Outline the process of generating pronunciations for OOV words and integrating them with MFA.\n\n---\n\n# ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n- Provide documentation of how MFA manages OOV words with G2P.  \n- Summarize at least 1–2 alternative tools and explain why MFA’s G2P is preferable.  \n- Document the steps for generating pronunciations for new words (English + Spanish).  \n- Identify potential issues (accuracy, accented characters, special symbols) and propose mitigations.  \n\n---\n\n# 🧪 Research Plan\n\n- Review MFA documentation and community discussions about G2P and OOV handling.  \n- Collect examples of how OOV words are managed in English and Spanish.  \n- Compare MFA’s built in G2P with alternatives at a conceptual level (ease of use, accuracy, integration).  \n- Recommend the best solution (likely MFA G2P) and describe how it could be implemented in practice.  \n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: 1–2 days.\n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [x] Medium  \n- [ ] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy  \n- [x] Moderate  \n- [ ] Hard  \n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: _@jose-valentin_\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"Fernando18Torres","id":180880125,"node_id":"U_kgDOCsgC_Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/180880125?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres","html_url":"https://github.com/Fernando18Torres","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/71/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/71/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

🎯 Objective\nResearch and evaluate lightweight forced alignment options to determine which approach (or combination) gives reliable syllable/word timings for short words and phrases. Produce reproducible experiment artifacts and a recommendation (with tradeoffs) for the team to act on.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nForced alignment finds where each word, syllable, or sound starts and ends in a recording using the transcript as a guide. This timing is essential: it tells us where to measure pitch and loudness for each syllable.\n\nThis research will:\n\n- Compare a small set of aligners (quick, developer-friendly tool vs. higher-quality batch tool vs. lighter Python options).\n\n- Produce reproducible scripts and a short analysis that shows the accuracy, runtime, and integration effort of each option.\n\n- Recommend the best fit for our needs (e.g., server-batch for dataset prep + quick aligner for near-real-time research), and describe fallback strategies in plain language.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n- Short comparison document (2–3 pages) describing 2–3 aligners, including: ease of setup, expected accuracy, typical runtime, and integration considerations (research perspective).\n\n - Short analysis (markdown) comparing timing differences (start/end deltas), and a small downstream check showing whether stress-detection decisions would change between aligners (simple metric + a few examples).\n\n - A clear, actionable recommendation: the preferred alignment approach to implement, with rationale and estimated effort.\n\n - A documented approach (simple heuristic) described with pseudo-code and recommended scenarios where it makes sense to use it.\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\nEvaluate tools that can be used to implement the idea:\n\n- a quick, developer-friendly aligner (e.g., Gentle) for fast experiments;\n\n- a higher-quality batch aligner (e.g., Montreal Forced Aligner) for reference;\n\n- a lightweight Python option (e.g., Aeneas) as a lightweight baseline.\n\nTool comparisons:\n\n- Compare timings: compute per-boundary absolute time differences (ms). Compare mean, median, and percent within 25 ms / 50 ms.\n\n- Downstream check: for a subset (e.g., 50 clips), compute per-syllable mean F0 (fundamental frequency) using the different alignments and compare resulting stress labels (did the stressed-syllable index change?).\n\n- Quality notes: cases where alignments fail (noisy audio, OOV words, very short clips) and note mitigation ideas.\n\n- Deliverable package: scripts, alignment outputs, comparison report, and recommendation.\n\n\nSuggested success heuristics for research:\n\n- Quick aligner produces word boundary deltas with a mean ≤ ~30 ms vs the batch aligner (reference).\n\n- Stress-label agreement ≥ 90% when using quick aligner vs batch aligner for the subset.\n\n- Scripts are reproducible by another developer with clear README instructions.  \n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: 1-3 days\n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [ ] Medium  \n- [✅] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy  \n- [✅] Moderate  \n- [ ] Hard  \n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: @Adriel-bracero  \n","closed_by":{"login":"Yulio7","id":90105310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMTA1MzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90105310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7","html_url":"https://github.com/Yulio7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/67/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/67/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

🎯 Objective\nResearch and prototype a lightweight preprocessing pipeline that improves the robustness of pitch and stress detection in noisy mobile recordings. The goal is a small, practical set of noise-handling techniques (VAD, denoising, trimming, normalization, augmentation) with a PoC (Proof of Concept) and measurable improvements against a baseline.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nMobile recordings are frequently degraded by background noise: street, fan, cafe, reverb, and inconsistent levels. This spike evaluates practical preprocessing steps and tools that make our stress/intonation detectors reliable in everyday use.\n\nKey goals:\n\n- Define a compact preprocessing pipeline that can run on-device or in a low-latency server.\n\n- Implement a PoC demonstrating improved pitch/stress detection under common noise conditions.\n\n- Guide thresholds/quality checks (SNR, voice activity, clipping) and recommendations for fallback UX (ask user to re-record, show a noise warning).\n\nCandidate building blocks to evaluate:\n\n-Voice Activity Detection (VAD) to trim silent segments and focus processing.\n\n-Lightweight denoising: spectral gating, Wiener filtering, or compact neural denoisers (e.g., RNNoise/WebRTC noise suppression).\n\n-Simple normalization: RMS or peak normalization to a target amplitude, with clipping checks.\n\n-SNR estimation and quality thresholds: compute an SNR-like metric to decide if audio is usable.\n\n-Data augmentation for training and evaluation: mix clean recordings with common noise samples at multiple SNRs.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n  - A documented preprocessing pipeline (VAD → denoise → trim → normalize → quality check) with rationale for each step.\n\n - PoC implementation(s): at least one on-device-friendly approach (e.g., WebRTC, RNNoise, or spectral gating) and one server-side option (if applicable). Code samples and run instructions included.\n\n - Benchmark report showing improvements vs baseline on a test set. The report must show results for clean and noisy sets (SNRs: clean, +10 dB, 0 dB, -5 dB).\n\n - Data augmentation recipe + scripts for producing noisy test sets (mixing noises at controlled SNRs).\n\n - Quality gating rules (SNR threshold, % voiced frames, clipping detection) and suggested frontend messages/actions.\n\n - Integration notes: how to call the pipeline from Flutter (native plugin or upload flow).\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\n Test data: start with a pilot dataset ~200 utterances across many speakers. Include noisy versions by mixing in several noise types (street, cafe, fan, TV).\n\nExperiments:\n\n- Baseline — no preprocessing; run existing F0/stress detector and record metrics.\n\n- VAD + Trim — remove silence and short non-voice segments; evaluate.\n\n- Spectral gating / Wiener — apply classic denoising; evaluate.\n\n- Compact neural denoiser — test RNNoise or a similarly lightweight model (on-device or server) and evaluate.\n\n- Full pipeline — VAD + denoise + normalize + quality gating.\n\nMetrics to record:\n\n- Stress placement accuracy (primary): percent correct stressed syllable.\n\n- Intonation classification accuracy (rising/falling/flat).\n\n- Voicing detection rate / valid frames % (frames where pitch was estimated).\n\n- False rejection rate of good samples by quality gate.\n\n- Latency: median and 95th percentile end-to-end (preproc + detector) on (a) dev laptop, (b) representative Android device.\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time:  1-5 days \n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [ ] Medium  \n- [✅] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy  \n- [ ] Moderate  \n- [✅] Hard  \n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: @Adriel-bracero  \n","closed_by":{"login":"Yulio7","id":90105310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMTA1MzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90105310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7","html_url":"https://github.com/Yulio7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/63/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/63/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

🎯 Objective\nCreate Flutter UI components for a Duolingo-style Daily Challenge that users can enter from a home card and complete on a simple inner page. The challenge alternates between Name and Word challenges and awards XP and continues streaks.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nWe need to build the frontend for a lightweight daily challenge experience in Flutter. The widget will show today's challenge \"Name\" or \"Word\" and the XP you'll earn. Tapping it opens a simple page with the where the user reads text and play audio, then user records input (stub) using a \"Record\" button, and Submits. The result view displays Success/Fail, the XP awarded, and a streak tick indicator.\n\nThis task is frontend/UI only; it should be ready to integrate with scoring/TTS later via provided hooks.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\nCore UI Components:\n[] Daily challenge widget on home with mode tag\n[] Daily challenge page with header (title, XP chip, streak icon)\n[] Prompt area:\n • Name Challenge → shows Name + IPA and Play button \n • Word Challenge → shows Word + optional hint and Play button\n[] Controls: Record and Submit buttons \n[] Result view: Success/Fail badge, XP earned\n[] Config-driven XP per mode (e.g., Name 20 XP, Word 10 XP)\n\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\nHow will this be tested?  \n[] Manual verification of both modes (Name/Word)\n[] Responsive layout across different screen sizes\n[] Manual testing with mock user progress data\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: 3 days \n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [ ] Medium  \n- [ ] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy  \n- [ ] Moderate  \n- [ ] Hard  \n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: @ignaaaaacio   \n","closed_by":{"login":"jorge-belgo2","id":178597500,"node_id":"U_kgDOCqUufA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/178597500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2","html_url":"https://github.com/jorge-belgo2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/62/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/62/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

🎯 Objective\nImplement a *daily challenge prompt UI* that motivates users with a simple task or goal each day.\n\n## 📝 Description\nWe need a frontend widget that displays a *\"Daily Challenge\"* card. This component will show the user a motivational task (ex, “Practice 5 words today” or “Log in twice this week”) with a fun design and clear call-to-action. When the user completes the challenge, the card should update to show success (e.g., checkmark animation or confetti). This will encourage short-term engagement and complement the long-term streak system.\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\nCore UI Components:\n[] Daily challenge card widget\n[] Shows challenge text + small icon/emoji\n[] Completion state with celebratory animation\n[] Ability to refresh with new challenge (mocked for now)\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\nHow will this be tested?\n[] Unit test to render daily challenge with mock data\n[] Manual test switching between “incomplete” and “complete” state\n[] Responsive layout check\n\n## ⏱ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: *2 days*\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\nMedium\n\n## 🎚 Difficulty\nEasy\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: @Brzno \nCo-developer: @EnriqueVilela2714 ","closed_by":{"login":"jorge-belgo2","id":178597500,"node_id":"U_kgDOCqUufA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/178597500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2","html_url":"https://github.com/jorge-belgo2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/61/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/61/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

🎯 Objective\nResearch whether our AI Pronunciation Coach should provide real-time pronunciation feedback (while the learner is speaking) or post-recording feedback (after finishing a word/sentence).\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nDifferent systems approach pronunciation feedback differently:\n- Real-time feedback can help learners adjust on the fly but may introduce latency and technical complexity.\n- Post-recording feedback is simpler to implement, allows detailed analysis (phoneme-level, intonation, clarity), but feels less immediate.\n\nThis research will:\n- Explore what existing tools (e.g., Elsa Speak, Speechling, Duolingo) do.\n- Identify whether Whisper, Vosk, or Kaldi/MFA can realistically support real-time scoring.\n- Compare usability trade-offs for learners.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Document differences between real-time vs. post-recording feedback.\n- [ ] Provide at least 2 examples of how existing apps handle it.\n- [ ] Evaluate feasibility of real-time feedback with our current tools (Whisper, Vosk, Kaldi/MFA).\n- [ ] Recommendation on whether our prototype should aim for real-time or post-recording feedback.\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\n- Check Whisper/Vosk documentation for streaming/real-time capabilities.\n- Test whether Whisper latency is acceptable for short sentences/words.\n- Compare output speed vs. accuracy in small trials.\n- Share findings with the team for design decision.\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: _1–2 days_  \n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low

🎯 Objective\nResearch and design a quiz word bank structure that can store words, definitions, distractors, and metadata, and recommend a storage format that is simple, scalable, and easy to load in both Python and Flutter/Dart.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nWe need to research a reliable way to organize and retrieve content for the quizzes. This task involves researching different ways to build a word bank, defining an outline that specifies what fields each word entry should contain (such as the word itself, its definition, distractors, and difficulty level), and comparing storage options like JSON, CSV, or SQLite to decide which is best for our objective. The outcome of this research will include a documented schema, a comparison of storage options with pros and cons, and a recommendation on the most suitable approach to implement it.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria \n- [x] Documented schema with required and optional fields. \n- [x] Compared at least 2-3 storage options (JSON, CSV, SQLite, etc.) with pros and cons.\n- [x] Recommendation of the most suitable storage option.\n- [x] At least 2–3 sample word entries that illustrate how the schema would look.\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\n- Review whether the schema is complete and covers quiz requirements.\n- Validate that sample entries are consistent with the proposed schema.\n- Confirm that references are credible and relevant for future implementation.\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: 2 days\n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [x] Medium  \n- [ ] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy  \n- [x] Moderate  \n- [ ] Hard  \n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: _@iralys-sanchez18_  \n","closed_by":{"login":"Yulio7","id":90105310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMTA1MzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90105310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7","html_url":"https://github.com/Yulio7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/59/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/59/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

🎯 Objective\nImplementing a secure login pipeline using the Supabase Authentication, the JWT tokens and multi factor authentication all integrated into a custom AppUser class in Dart for profile management.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nWe need a clear and effective authentication flow design that uses supabase auth to handle the sign-up/sign-in with the ability to issue the JWT tokens to the backend. It should sync authentication data (id, email) with a feature supabase contains called Profile tables containing additional information (username, full_name, avatar_url, role, mfa_enabled, last_login). Then it all gets merged with the AppUser class that Dart utilizes so a single model can be used in the application. It should also validate the tokens on the backend before granting access and is able to keep sessions alive until the user logs out or the tokens do not match.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\nList the conditions that must be met for this issue to be considered complete.  \n- [ ] Visual diagram that shows the flow from login -> JWT token -> MFA -> profile merge -> AppUser creation\n- [ ] A defined user data model using AppUser that combines authentication and profile data.\n- [ ] Backend verification process is clear as well.  \n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\nHow will this be tested?  \n- The secure login should meet the best practices in terms of security and should handle mfa, tokens and data effectively.\n- Login flow should be simple and intuitive for the user without any unecessary complications\n- AppUser and the profiles table should support future growth with different features.\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: 1-3 days\n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [x] Medium  \n- [ ] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy  \n- [x] Moderate  \n- [ ] Hard  \n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: @JuliT02 \n","closed_by":{"login":"pedroamorales","id":149693528,"node_id":"U_kgDOCOwkWA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/149693528?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedroamorales","html_url":"https://github.com/pedroamorales","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedroamorales/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedroamorales/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedroamorales/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedroamorales/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedroamorales/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedroamorales/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedroamorales/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedroamorales/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedroamorales/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/58/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/58/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

Objective\nResearch and prototype a robust, low-cost method to extract fundamental frequency (F0) on mobile devices and normalize it per-speaker so pitch features can be compared across voices.\n\n---\n\n📝 Description\nWe need research to pick an F0 extraction library/algorithm (e.g., autocorrelation, YIN, or available mobile libraries), measure reliability across typical phone microphones, and implement pitch normalization (log F0). Deliver a tiny PoC that extracts F0 from short recordings and outputs a normalized pitch trace. Note links to integration into Flutter (native plugin or pure-Dart).\n\nWhy: intonation detection relies on good F0. Without reliable F0, rising/falling decisions will fail or be biased by speaker pitch range.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n - Short comparison (3 methods) showing success rate and typical errors on 30 test recordings (male/female/child).\n \n - PoC script / native plugin demo that records audio and returns F0 contour (CSV or JSON).\n  \n - Normalization strategy documented (e.g., semitone conversion + z-score) with rationale.\n \n - Integration notes (how to call from Flutter; example API).\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\n-Collect 30–50 short utterances (varied speakers).\n\n-Run each extractor, compute error vs hand-checked pitch at 10 sample points per file.\n\n-Evaluate robustness in quiet vs noisy snippets (add background noise). \n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: 1-5 days\n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [ ] Medium  \n- [✅] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy  \n- [✅] Moderate  \n- [ ] Hard  \n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: @Adriel-bracero\n","closed_by":{"login":"Yulio7","id":90105310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMTA1MzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90105310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7","html_url":"https://github.com/Yulio7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/57/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/57/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

This includes identifying login methods (email/password, SSO, 2FA), deciding on necessary fields, handling validation and error messages, ensuring accessibility (keyboard navigation, password toggle, screen readers), and mapping out the user journey from app entry to successful login. The goal is to gather insights and ideas that will guide future implementation in Flutter.\n\n✅ Acceptance Criteria\nResearch Deliverables:\n[] Identify and compare common login methods (email/password, SSO, phone/OTP, 2FA).\n[] Define necessary input fields (email, password, optional 2FA).\n[] Document input validation rules and error handling approaches.\n[] Brainstorm element placement (fields, buttons, “forgot password,” sign-up option).\n[] Research flow & usability (user journey, accessibility, recovery options, security features).\n[] Combine both partners’ findings into a single, clear document.\n\n🧪 Testing Plan\nSince this is a research/brainstorming issue, validation will be through review, not code testing:\n[] Peer review of research findings.\n[] Team feedback on proposed login flow and structure.\n[] Cross-check with accessibility guidelines.\n[] Ensure both functional (inputs) and usability (flow) aspects are covered.\n\n⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: 1 week\n\n⚡ Urgency\n\n- [ ] Low\n- [ ] Medium\n- [ ] High\n\n🎚️ Difficulty\n\n- [ ]Easy\n- [ ] Moderate\n- [ ] Hard\n\n👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested researcher: @aryamdiaz \nCo-Researcher: @kevinlara1 ","closed_by":{"login":"Fernando18Torres","id":180880125,"node_id":"U_kgDOCsgC_Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/180880125?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres","html_url":"https://github.com/Fernando18Torres","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/50/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/50/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

The information obtained in this research would be passed on to a future issue which aims to implement a simple version of the word comparator.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n  \n- [x] Have at least one MFA model that requires no payment, doesnt require alot to run, and can execute the word comparison task\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: _e.g., 3 days\n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [ ] Medium  \n- [x] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [x] Easy  \n- [ ] Moderate  \n- [ ] Hard  \n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: Uriel-D  \n","closed_by":{"login":"Yulio7","id":90105310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMTA1MzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90105310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7","html_url":"https://github.com/Yulio7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/49/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/49/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

**Objective**\nCreate Flutter UI components for the streak & gamification system that motivates users through daily streak tracking, points, and achievement badges.\n\n📝 **Description**\nWe need to build the frontend components that display the user’s gamification progress. This includes a streak counter, point system visualization, and achievement badges that unlock as the user reaches milestones. The UI should feel rewarding and engaging, providing clear feedback that encourages users to return daily. It will integrate with the backend scoring and streak logic to show real-time updates.\n\n✅ **Acceptance Criteria**\nCore UI Components:\n\\[] Streak counter widget (daily login/usage streak)\n\\[] Points/XP display with progress bar or counter\n\\[] Achievement badge system with unlock animations\n\\[] Notification or highlight when user hits a milestone (e.g., 7-day streak)\n\n🧪 **Testing Plan**\nHow will this be tested?\n\\[] Unit testing for streak/points components\n\\[] Responsive layout across different screen sizes\n\\[] Manual testing with mock streak and points data\n\\[] Testing animations and milestone unlock flows\n\n⏱️ **Timeframe**\nEstimated completion time: **1 week**\n\n⚡ **Urgency**\n\nMedium\n\n🎚️ **Difficulty**\n\nModerate\n\n👨‍💻 **Recommended Assigned Developer**\nSuggested developer: @EnriqueVilela2714 \nCo-Developer: @Brzno \n","closed_by":{"login":"jorge-belgo2","id":178597500,"node_id":"U_kgDOCqUufA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/178597500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2","html_url":"https://github.com/jorge-belgo2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/43/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/43/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

🎯 Objective\nResearch and establish the foundation for Progress Analytics by investigating backend options, data tracking approaches, and data modeling practices that can later support capturing completion statistics, performance metrics, and learning progress.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nBefore implementation begins, we need to explore possible backend solutions that will power progress analytics. This research should cover API and database/storage options, suitable data tracking methods, and potential data models (e.g., Users, Tasks, Progress).\n\nThe outcome of this task is a well-documented recommendation report that will guide the backend implementation phase and ensure smooth integration with the Flutter frontend.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Research and summarize at least 2–3 viable API + database/storage options for progress analytics.\n- [ ] Investigate and document at least 2-3 data tracking methods.\n- [ ] Research how backend progress analytics can be integrated with the frontend dashboard and provide 2-3 examples.\n- [ ] Provide an initial conceptual data model sketch.\n- [ ] Provide documentation detailing research findings.\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\nHow will this be tested?  \n- Verify that multiple API + DB/storage options are documented with pros/cons.\n- Verify that more than one data tracking method is evaluated and compared.\n- Validate that the conceptual data model sketch aligns with real-world examples and can support the analytics goals.\n- Confirm that the research deliverable is shared with the team for feedback.\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: 1 week\n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [x] Medium  \n- [X] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy  \n- [X] Moderate  \n- [ ] Hard  \n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: @ivxnmorxles \nCo-Developer: @AlexMoralesDev\n","closed_by":{"login":"jorge-belgo2","id":178597500,"node_id":"U_kgDOCqUufA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/178597500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2","html_url":"https://github.com/jorge-belgo2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/37/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/37/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

Objective\n\nResearch and design Regional/Cultural Name Pronunciation Packs (initial focus: Hispanic and English names), to understand how to source name lists, generate audio (TTS vs. recordings), and deliver a practice UX flow.\n\n⸻\n\n📝 Description\n\nName pronunciation is crucially important when learning pronunciation in a different language, and in some cases, knowing how to pronounce a name correctly will open more doors for you than most words.\n\nThis task involves gathering research and producing a design blueprint for implementing “Name Pronunciation Packs” by culture or region. Specifically, start with Hispanic and English name packs, and plan for future expansion (e.g., Indian, Chinese, European names). The deliverable will be a PDF that includes:\n\t•\tSources of reliable name lists by region\n\t•\tComparison of audio generation strategies (TTS vs. crowdsourced recordings)\n\t•\tA sample pack (20 names each) for Hispanic and English names (with IPA and placeholder audio)\n\t•\tSample UX flow for how users access and practice these packs\n\n⸻\n\n✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\t•\tIdentified at least reliable data sources for Hispanic names and 3 for English names\n\t•\tCompare pros/cons of TTS vs. native recordings for pronunciation audio\n\t•\tCreate an example pack of 20+ Hispanic names and 20+ English names with IPA and placeholder audio flows\n\t•\tDeliver a workflow illustrating how users select and practice name packs\n\n⸻\n\n🧪 Testing Plan\n\t•\tReview the PDF: verify that data sources are credible\n\t•\tSpot-check 10 names in each sample pack for IPA accuracy\n\t•\tReview UX workflow to ensure it logically follows selection → practice → feedback journey\n\n⸻\n\n⏱️ Timeframe\n\nEstimated completion time: 2 days\n\n⸻\n\n⚡ Urgency\n\t•\tLow\n\tX\tMedium\n\t•\tHigh\n\n⸻\n\n🎚️ Difficulty\n\t•\tEasy\n\tX\tModerate\n\t•\tHard\n\n⸻\n\n👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\n\nSuggested: @ignaaaaacio ","closed_by":{"login":"jorge-belgo2","id":178597500,"node_id":"U_kgDOCqUufA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/178597500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2","html_url":"https://github.com/jorge-belgo2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/30/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/30/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

Objective\nImplement a feature that breaks down a word into its phoneme components (IPA) and provides phoneme-by-phoneme playback so learners can focus on difficult sounds before practicing full words.\n\n📝 Description\nWe want to allow users to hear and practice each phoneme within a word. For example, the word “cat” would be broken into /k/ /æ/ /t/, and the system would play each sound separately via TTS. This will scaffold learning by giving users smaller, easier chunks to practice.\n\nPhoneme Extraction\n\n- Convert input word into IPA phonemes.\n\n- Split phonemes into an ordered sequence.\n\nPlayback Functionality\n\n- Enable phoneme-by-phoneme playback using TTS.\n\n- Allow users to repeat each phoneme individually.\n\nFeedback Integration\n\n- Compare user’s attempt at a single phoneme to the target phoneme.\n\n- Provide micro-feedback before moving on to the full word.\n\n✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n- Word is automatically converted into its phoneme sequence (IPA).\n\n- Each phoneme can be played individually via TTS.\n\n- User can attempt phoneme pronunciation and receive feedback.\n\n- Feature integrates smoothly into the overall pronunciation coach flow.\n\n🧪 Testing Plan\n\n- Collect a small dataset of phonemes (e.g., from CMU Pronouncing Dictionary).\n\n- Test playback accuracy for different phonemes.\n\n- Test phoneme feedback with varying user speech quality.\n\n- Ensure low latency between phoneme playback and user retry.\n\n⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated research & prototype duration: 2–4 days\n\n⚡ Urgency\nLow\nMedium ✅\nHigh\n\n🎚️ Difficulty\nEasy\nModerate ✅\nHard\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: @Dieg0Rios \n","closed_by":{"login":"jorge-belgo2","id":178597500,"node_id":"U_kgDOCqUufA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/178597500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2","html_url":"https://github.com/jorge-belgo2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/27/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/27/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

🎯 Objective\n## Find a specific way on how to implement AI in providing a response to the user and verify if it can be implemented in other areas of the project. \n\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nAI will be implemented in the responses to a user's pronunciation. We need to find the most efficient and useful way to use AI and how to make sure the AI makes the least amount of errors as possible. Investigating how other apps/websites make use of AI might help us get a better understanding on how to do these things. Some apps/websites also have a \"AI helper\" where you may ask the AI whatever question you may have. Researching this might also help us be more efficient. \n\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\nResearch should include:\n- [ ] Document clearly how exactly to implement AI in our app\n- [ ]  Give 3+ examples on how other apps/websites have made AI helpers\n- [ ] Provide 2+ examples on efficient ways to use AI in providing feedback to users. \n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\nHow will this be tested?  \n- Ask for Group feedback on the documented reaserch and examples provided\n- Implement examples provided in a separate project to verify the utility of each and compare the results to results on the apps/websites researched.\n\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: 1-3 days  \n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [x] Medium  \n- [ ] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [x] Easy  \n- [ ] Moderate  \n- [ ] Hard  \n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: _@ClaudiaI-Guzman_  \n","closed_by":{"login":"jorge-belgo2","id":178597500,"node_id":"U_kgDOCqUufA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/178597500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2","html_url":"https://github.com/jorge-belgo2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-belgo2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/26/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/26/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

🎯 Objective\nExplore best practices for adaptive dashboards in pronunciation learning apps. Focusing on how dashboards can personalize what they show depending on the user’s level of progress and recent performance.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nOur AI pronunciation coach needs a dashboard that doesn’t just display static progress but adapts as the learner grows. This research task will explore adaptive dashboard patterns, emphasizing personalization and progressive complexity. The research should focus on:\n\nAdaptive Dashboard Structures\nBeginner: simple progress bar, daily target, motivational visuals, simplified visuals and avatars.\nIntermediate: error tracking, accuracy breakdowns, “Top 3 Mistakes” list.\nAdvanced: detailed phoneme mastery , weekly/monthly trend graphs, next-best practice recommendation.\n\nAdaptive Principles\nTiered Information: show more detail as skill improves.\nProgressive Reveal: unlock advanced visualizations after consistent use.\nPersonalized Recommendations: dashboard highlights the next-best practice item based on recent errors and performance.\n\nInspirations from Existing Apps\nEducational apps: adaptive lesson progression and “next recommended task” systems.\nFitness platforms: simplified dashboards for casual users vs. detailed analytics for advanced users.\nMobile games: progressive reveal of features, tiered feedback, and reward-based engagement.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n- Document 3+ examples of adaptive dashboards.\n- Provide 3+ preliminary dashboard layouts with descriptions of what each shows.\n- Identify at least 2 adaptive principles (e.g., progressive reveal, tiered info) with evidence from real apps.\n- Documentation detailing previously mentioned points.\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\nHow will this be tested?  \n- Validate findings with examples from educational, fitness, and mobile gaming platforms.\n- Compare effectiveness of simple vs. complex dashboards for different user types.\n- Check accessibility and clarity of proposed dashboard layouts. \n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: 1 to 3 days.\n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [x] Low  \n- [ ] Medium  \n- [ ] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy  \n- [X] Moderate  \n- [ ] Hard  \n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: ivxnmorxles\n","closed_by":{"login":"Yulio7","id":90105310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMTA1MzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90105310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7","html_url":"https://github.com/Yulio7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/20/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/20/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

🎯 Objective\nResearch and define the optimal Flutter-based approach for building our initial milestone: a functional Login Page with input validation and a simple, aesthetically pleasing Home Page. This research will ensure we use the most efficient widgets, state management techniques, and project structure from the start.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nThis research task is critical for the frontend team's work in Weeks 1 and 2. We need to investigate and decide on the following for the Login and Home pages using Flutter:\n1.  **Login Page Implementation:**\n    *   Best widgets for building forms: `TextFormField` vs. `TextField` with custom `InputDecoration`.\n    *   Techniques for robust form validation (using the `validator` property and a `GlobalKey<FormState>`).\n    *   How to handle state for the form inputs (e.g., using `TextEditingController` or a state management solution).\n    *   Methods to provide user feedback (e.g., `SnackBar` for errors, navigating to Home on success).\n\n2.  **State Management (Basic):**\n    *   Research the simplest approach for our current needs (e.g., `setState` within a single widget).\n    *   Evaluate if a more scalable solution like `Provider` or `Bloc` is necessary for this initial milestone or if it can be added later.\n\n3.  **Home Page Design & Structure:**\n    *   Research basic layout widgets (`Scaffold`, `AppBar`, `Container`, `Column`, `Row`) to create a simple structure.\n    *   Investigate how to create a navigation flow (e.g., `Navigator.pushReplacement` to go from Login to Home).\n    *   Look into pre-designed `Card` widgets or list tiles to display content neatly.\n\n4.  **Styling & Theming:**\n    *   Research how to use the `ThemeData` class to define a consistent color scheme and typography for the app.\n    *   Evaluate the use of external packages like `flutter_bloc` for state management or `google_fonts` for typography, if needed.\n\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] A documented guide on building a validated login form in Flutter.\n- [ ] A recommended approach for handling form state and navigation.\n- [ ] A code snippet for a basic Login Page and Home Page skeleton.\n- [ ] A decided-upon project structure for our screens and widgets.\n- [ ] A list of relevant external packages (with version numbers) to add to `pubspec.yaml`\n \n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\n- The findings will be tested by implementing the Login and Home pages according to the research.\n- We will verify that the input boxes capture data and validate correctly.\n- We will test the navigation between the Login and Home pages.\n- We will ensure the UI is visually consistent and runs on both Android and iOS emulators.\n\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated research duration: **1 day**\n*(This research is needed immediately to start Week 1 development effectively)*\n\n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [ ] Medium  \n- [x] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy  \n- [x] Moderate  \n- [ ] Hard  \n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: _@FabianVelezOcasio_  \n","closed_by":{"login":"Fernando18Torres","id":180880125,"node_id":"U_kgDOCsgC_Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/180880125?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres","html_url":"https://github.com/Fernando18Torres","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/19/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/19/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

🎯 Objective\nResearch and document possible methods to validate a spoken word after it has been transcribed by speech-to-text. It should confirm that it’s a real and valid input in the target language.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\n\nIn order to properly verify the pronunciation of the user, we first need to validate whether the word they spoke actually exists in our target language. If the STT pipeline produces a result that isn’t a real word, then pronunciation feedback would be meaningless.\n\nTasks:\n\nLook at a few reliable dictionary/lexicon options that could be used.\n\nNote how these sources handle different cases (capitalization, plurals, hyphenated words, names, acronyms).\n\nDecide the bare minimum rule for input validity (strict match vs. \"close enough\").\n\nList possible risks or limits (e.g., missing words, API usage caps).\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n- [x] Review at least 2–3 dictionary/lexicon sources.\n- [x] Document pros and cons of each source (coverage, ease of use, limits).\n- [x] Recommend at least one source for word validation.\n- [x] Identify at least one fallback source to use if the recommended source fails.\n- [x] Identify a basic coding approach.\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\n- Compare at least 2–3 options with a small test set of words (normal, plural, hyphenated, proper noun, acronym) and note how they are handled.\n- Use official documentation and credible sources for each dictionary/lexicon.\n- Write results in a summary that follows the project’s documentation standards.\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: 1 - 2 days\n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [x] Medium  \n- [ ] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy  \n- [x] Moderate  \n- [ ] Hard  \n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer: _@iralys-sanchez18_  \n","closed_by":{"login":"Yulio7","id":90105310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMTA1MzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90105310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7","html_url":"https://github.com/Yulio7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/16/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/16/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

🎯 Objective\nResearch a simple, prototype ready method to detect stress placement and basic word level intonation (rising vs. falling) for short words and phrases.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nThis task will investigate methods for giving learners real-time feedback on stress placement and intonation in short utterances (single words or short phrases).\n\nUser flow (how learners will use it):\n     The learner records a short word or phrase.\n     The system analyzes the recording and highlights which syllable was stressed.\n     The system shows whether the overall intonation went up or down.\n     The learner sees corrections and can retry immediately.\n\nExpected outputs:\n     1.

🎯 Objective\nResearch and propose a session management strategy for Flutter that covers access/refresh tokens, proactive refresh, and graceful logout on expiration—without implementing it

Compare approaches: proactive refresh (timer/expiry awareness) vs reactive refresh (on 401), single source of truth for session state, secure storage options, and retry/backoff patterns. Survey Flutter/Dart libraries/utilities (e.g., http interceptors, dio interceptors, Riverpod/BLoC patterns) and provider-specific docs (Firebase/Supabase/Auth0) to identify best practices and pitfalls (clock skew, token rotation, race conditions, multiple concurrent refreshes).\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Token storage guidance (what goes in secure storage vs memory) and rotation policy.\n- [ ] Error/edge-case handling plan (clock skew, refresh failure, concurrent calls).\n- [ ] Suggested tooling (packages/patterns) and simple sequence outline.\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\nHow will this be tested?  \n- Define a research validation plan: scenarios to test once implemented (forced expiry, network loss during refresh, concurrent requests, backoff).\n- Include measurable success criteria (no infinite loops; single refresh for N concurrent calls; <X ms added latency on refresh).\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated completion time: 2 – 3 hours\n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n- [ ] Low  \n- [ ] Medium  \n- [x] High  \n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n- [ ] Easy  \n- [x] Moderate  \n- [ ] Hard  \n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\nSuggested developer:  @alondra-arce  \n","closed_by":{"login":"Yulio7","id":90105310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMTA1MzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90105310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7","html_url":"https://github.com/Yulio7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yulio7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/12/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/12/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

The idea is to:\n\n1. **Daily Challenge Mechanics**\n\n   * A new pronunciation challenge is available every 24 hours.\n   * Completing it gives a **base score** (e.g., 100 points).\n\n2. **Streak & Reset System**\n\n   * Users earn a **streak** by completing challenges on consecutive days.\n   * Streak resets if the user misses a day.\n\n3. **Bonus Challenges**\n\n   * On specific days (e.g., every 5th day), users are offered a **bonus challenge** that is harder but worth **double points**.\n\n4. **Motivation & Retention**\n\n   * Research UI/UX patterns that show streak progression.\n   * Look at how apps use **points + streaks** to maximize daily retention.\n\nDeliverable: A document (`docs/daily-challenge-score-research.md`) summarizing score systems, streak mechanics, and bonus challenges from language-learning apps and gamified platforms.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n* [ ] Document at least 3 examples of apps using score + streak systems.\n* [ ] Research how daily reset mechanics are communicated to users.\n* [ ] Identify at least 2 methods for bonus/multiplier challenges.\n* [ ] Provide recommendations on how to adapt these ideas for **pronunciation-specific challenges**.\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\n\n* Validate findings with examples (Duolingo streaks, Memrise points, fitness app streaks, etc.).\n* Check how scoring affects long-term engagement (credible sources).\n* Ensure recommendations align with pronunciation practice (not just generic quiz mechanics).\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\n\nEstimated completion time: **2–3 days** \n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Urgency\n\n* [ ] Low\n* [x] Medium\n* [ ] High\n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ Difficulty\n\n* [ ] Easy\n* [x] Moderate\n* [ ] Hard\n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Recommended Assigned Developer\n\nSuggested developer: @EnriqueVilela2714 \n\n---","closed_by":{"login":"Fernando18Torres","id":180880125,"node_id":"U_kgDOCsgC_Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/180880125?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres","html_url":"https://github.com/Fernando18Torres","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fernando18Torres/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/11/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uprm-inso4101-2025-2026-s1/semester-project-pronunciation-coach/issues/11/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}

🎯 Objective\nExplore methods to provide **real-time pronunciation feedback** in a Results/Feedback screen by comparing user speech with sample consonant and vowel sounds by converting sounds into graphs and analyzing the similarity between them.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Description\nWe need to figure out if it's possible to turn speech samples from English consonants and vowels as well as user speech into a format that we can compare to display the pronunciation feedback.\n\n1. **Graph Construction**  \n   - Convert sample and user speech as graphs.  \n\n2. **Mathematical Comparison**  \n   - Compare sample and user speech graphs. \n\n3. **Feedback Generation**  \n   - Translate similarity scores into a **confidence percentage (0 to 100%)**.  \n   - Define feedback as: ✅ Correct, 🔄 Needs Improvement.  \n\n---\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria  \n- [x] System generates graphs for both sample and user audio.   \n- [x] Mathematical comparison produces a similarity/confidence score (0 to 100%).   \n- [x] Graph generation and comparison runs good enough to use in real-time. \n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Testing Plan\n- Collect a dataset of English consonants and vowels (sample + user).   \n- Test in real-time to make sure feedback is displayed with minimal (or acceptable) latency.\n- Include cases such as background noise or different accents.\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Timeframe\nEstimated research
