== 1. Informative Part

=== 1.1 Teams
- List each team with their members 
- Identify any external partners (clients, experts, etc.)
- Describe roles and responsibilities

=== 1.2 Current Situation, Needs, Ideas

==== 1.2.1 Current Situation
- Describe context and environment
- Reference sources or data if possible

==== 1.2.2 Needs
- List the needs people have in this context
- Keep needs independent of your app/system

==== 1.2.3 Ideas
- Document your ideas for satisfying the needs
- Keep it feature-oriented, not implementation-oriented

=== 1.3 Scope, Span, and Synopsis

==== 1.3.1 Scope and Span
- Broad area (scope) and specific concern (span)

==== 1.3.2 Synopsis
- Executive summary of the whole project

=== 1.4 Other Activities (Beyond Coding)
- Domain engineering
- Requirements analysis
- Architecture
- Testing
- Deployment

=== 1.5 Derived Goals
- Secondary outcomes, beyond the primary project goal

== 2. Descriptive Part

=== 2.1 Domain Description

==== 2.1.1 Domain Rough Sketch
- Brainstormed/raw notes, interviews, observations

==== 2.1.2 Terminology
- Define important terms from the domain
- Distinguish domain vs. non-domain concepts

==== 2.1.3 Domain Terminology vs Rough Sketch
- Show how terminology came from sketch analysis

==== 2.1.4 Narrative
- Story of the domain independent of your system-to-be

==== 2.1.5 Events, Actions, Behaviors
- Distinguish between events, actions, and behaviors

==== 2.1.6 Function Signatures

==== 2.2.3 Domain Requirements
- Derive system requirements from domain properties

==== 2.2.4 Interface Requirements
- Shared phenomena between system and domain

==== 2.2.5 Machine Requirements
- Measurable constraints on performance, stability, etc.

=== 2.3 Implementation

==== 2.3.1 Selected Fragments of Implementation
- Architecture diagrams
- Screen sketches
- Code snippets (only if they clarify something)

== 3. Analytic Part

=== 3.1 Concept Analysis
