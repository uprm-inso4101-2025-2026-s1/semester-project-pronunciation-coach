# [Lecture Topic Task] <Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) and System Quality Trade-offs>

## Details
## 🎯 Objective
Define, analyze, and apply Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) in software projects, focusing on how different quality attributes (performance, usability, security, availability, maintainability) interact and trade off during system design decisions.

---

## 📝 Description
This lecture topic task explores how NFRs shape the architecture and behavior of a system. While functional requirements specify what the software does, NFRs determine how well it performs. Students will identify key NFR categories, describe measurable quality attributes, and analyze how improving one may negatively affect another. Examples include conflicts like performance vs. security or usability vs. reliability. The task connects concepts from the Requirements Engineering and Software Design lectures, using real-world cases such as an airline timetable or e-commerce platform to demonstrate how engineers balance system qualities under constraints.

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- Define at least five main NFR categories (e.g., performance, usability, security, availability, maintainability).
- Provide one concrete example and measurable metric for each NFR.
- Create a trade-off matrix comparing at least three quality attributes.
- Include a short scenario (airline timetable, web app, etc.) showing a real design decision between conflicting NFRs.
- Explain how developers can evaluate and verify NFR satisfaction (tests, logs, metrics).

---

## 🧪 Testing Plan
- Review examples for clarity and completeness of NFR definitions.
- Check that each NFR has measurable criteria and potential verification method.
- Validate trade-off reasoning using one sample system scenario.
- Peer-review deliverable for consistency with lecture materials (Requirements & Design).
