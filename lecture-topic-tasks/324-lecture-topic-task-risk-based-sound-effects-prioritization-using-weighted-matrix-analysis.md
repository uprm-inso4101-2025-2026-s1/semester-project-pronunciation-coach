## Details
## 🎯 Objective
Apply Quantitative Risk Analysis and Weighted Matrix Evaluation to prioritize sound effect implementations based on risk mitigation value, development, and user impact for the Pronunciation Coach app.

---

## 📝 Description
This lecture topic uses the Requirements Evaluation framework from Chapter 3 to systematically evaluate and prioritize sound effect features through risk analysis and quantitative decision-making. The approach combines:
**Risk Analysis Components:**
•	Product Risks: Sound effects that could negatively impact learning experience
•	Process Risks: Development challenges in audio implementation
•	Risk Documentation: Structured assessment of likelihood and impact
**Weighted Matrix Application:**
•	Evaluation Criteria: Learning effectiveness, user satisfaction, technical feasibility, accessibility
•	Quantitative Scoring: Percentage-based satisfaction estimates for each option
•	Weighted Totals: Objective prioritization based on multiple criteria
**Key Lecture Concepts Applied from Risk Analysis PDF from INSO4101 in moodle:**
•	Slide 45: Weighted matrix for option evaluation
•	Slide 46: Risk analysis in requirements evaluation
•	Slide 48: Value-cost prioritization
•	Slide 50: AHP pairwise comparison


---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
•	Risk analysis document identifying 5+ sound effect-related risks
•	Weighted matrix comparing 4+ sound effect implementation options
•	Value-cost prioritization diagram for sound effect features
•	AHP comparison matrix for criteria weighting
•	Final prioritized sound effect implementation plan


---

## 🧪 Testing Plan
•	Validate risk assessments with user testing scenarios
•	Verify matrix calculations for consistency
•	Cross-reference prioritization with existing requirements
•	Test implementation feasibility with development team
