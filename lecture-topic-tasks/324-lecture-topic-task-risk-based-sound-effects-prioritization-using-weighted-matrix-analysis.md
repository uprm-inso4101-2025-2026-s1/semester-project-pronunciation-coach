## Details
## 🎯 Objective
Apply Quantitative Risk Analysis and Weighted Matrix Evaluation to prioritize sound effect implementations based on risk mitigation value, development, and user impact for the Pronunciation Coach app.

---

## 📝 Description
This lecture topic uses the Requirements Evaluation framework to systematically evaluate and prioritize sound effect features through risk analysis and quantitative decision-making. The approach combines:

**Risk Analysis Components:**

- Product Risks: Sound effects that could negatively impact learning experience
- Process Risks: Development challenges in audio implementation
- Risk Documentation: Structured assessment of likelihood and impact

**Weighted Matrix Application:**

- Evaluation Criteria: Learning effectiveness, user satisfaction, technical feasibility, accessibility
- Quantitative Scoring: Percentage-based satisfaction estimates for each option
- Weighted Totals: Objective prioritization based on multiple criteria

**Key Lecture Concepts Applied from Risk Analysis PDF from INSO4101 in moodle:**

- Slide 45: Weighted matrix for option evaluation
- Slide 46: Risk analysis in requirements evaluation
- Slide 48: Value-cost prioritization
- Slide 50: AHP pairwise comparison


---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- Risk analysis document identifying 5+ sound effect-related risks
- Weighted matrix comparing 4+ sound effect implementation options
- Value-cost prioritization diagram for sound effect features
- AHP comparison matrix for criteria weighting
- Final prioritized sound effect implementation plan


---

## 🧪 Testing Plan

- Validate risk assessments with user testing scenarios
- Verify matrix calculations for consistency
- Cross-reference prioritization with existing requirements
- Test implementation feasibility with development team
