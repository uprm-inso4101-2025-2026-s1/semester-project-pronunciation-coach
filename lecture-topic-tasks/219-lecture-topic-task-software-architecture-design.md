## Details
## 🎯 Objective
Introduce a high-level software architecture view of the system platform to explicitly connect implementation decisions with system-level structure. This task fills the current documentation gap between requirements/domain modeling and detailed UML diagrams by explaining how the system is organized into architectural components and why this structure satisfies the needs of extensibility, modularity, and maintainability.

---

## 📝 Description
While existing documentation includes domain models, behavioral diagrams (sequence diagrams, statecharts), and requirements analysis, there is no architectural layer that explains how these pieces fit together at the system level.
This issue will add a new subsection outlining:

-The system’s architectural style 
-The main architectural components
---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
[]Create a documentation explaining in detail       .
[]The architecture is described using at least one architectural view 
[]Clear separation of concerns is documented
---

## 🧪 Testing Plan
Because architecture cannot be “unit tested” traditionally, correctness will be validated through:

-Traceability checks: Every architectural component has a corresponding responsibility in the system.
-Coverage checks: All major system features  appear in the architecture.
