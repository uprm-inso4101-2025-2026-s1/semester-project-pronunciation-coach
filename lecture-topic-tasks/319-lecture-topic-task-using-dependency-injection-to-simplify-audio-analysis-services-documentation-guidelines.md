## Details
🎯 Objective

Refactor the audio analysis system to use dependency injection, improving modularity, testability, and code maintainability.

⸻

📝 Description

This task introduces a dependency-injection pattern for all audio-related services, including waveform extraction, noise filtering, pronunciation scoring, and model inference.
The current audio pipeline likely has tightly coupled classes; DI will allow services to be swapped, extended, or mocked more easily, especially when building lecture demos or running local tests.
Deliverables include a DI container structure, refactored audio service classes, and example usage snippets.

⸻

✅ Acceptance Criteria
	•	DI container created for audio-related services
	•	All audio services refactored to use constructor injection
	•	Interfaces or abstract classes defined for each service
	•	Unit tests using mocked audio services
	•	Updated documentation explaining the new architecture

⸻

🧪 Testing Plan
	•	Unit testing with mocked dependencies
	•	Stress tests to ensure no regressions in audio performance
	•	Manual tests validating that real audio analysis still works
	•	Verify hot-swapping of services (e.g., alternate noise-filter implementations)
