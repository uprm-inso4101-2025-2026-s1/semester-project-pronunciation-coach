# [Lecture Topic Task]: Add Glossary Section for Team 3 Documentation

## Details
## 🎯 Objective
Create a new Section 1.6 "Glossary of Terms" for **Team 3 documentation** following the "Documents" lecture guidelines to provide clear definitions for all technical terms used in the project.

---

## 📝 Description
**Lecture Connection:** "Terminology" section in the "Documents" lecture. Which states that projects must have terms with clear definitions.

### What's Missing:
Our documentation uses many technical terms without defining them clearly:
- "MFCC analysis" (used in Section 1.2.3 and 2.1.5 without explanation)
- "Elo rating system" (mentioned in Section 1.1.1 and 1.2.3)
- "IPA-based TTS" (Section 1.1.1)
- "Progressive disclosure" (Section 1.2.3)
- "SharedPreferences" (throughout Section 2.3)
- "Provider pattern" (Section 2.3.1)

The "Documents" lecture shows that a glossary helps prevent confusion and makes sure everyone on the team understands the terms.

### What the Documents Lecture Teaches:

From terminology section:
- Terms need textual definitions
- No circular definitions

### What to Do:

1. **Create new Section 1.6 "Glossary of Terms"** for Team 3 documentation.

2. **List and define these terms alphabetically:**
   - Accuracy Score
   - Adaptive Difficulty
   - Elo Rating System
   - Flutter
   - Gamification
   - IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet)
   - MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)
   - Progressive Disclosure
   - Provider Pattern
   - SharedPreferences

3. **Write each definition in 1-2 sentences maximum** - clear and simple
