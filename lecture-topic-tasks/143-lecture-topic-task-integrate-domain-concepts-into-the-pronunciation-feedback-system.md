## Details
## 🎯 Objective
Document how domain concepts from the Domain Engineering and Domain Facets lecture can be represented in the Pronunciation Coach’s feedback, ensuring feedback aligns with real-world pronunciation learning contexts.

---

## 📝 Description
The Domain Engineering and Domain Facets lecture emphasizes that software must model relevant real-world concepts. The feedback system must distinguish between different domain concepts such as articulation, intonation, or rhythm. This task creates documentation and a model (table or diagram) mapping key domain concepts to their system representations and identifies missing or ambiguous concepts.



---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Diagram or table linking domain concepts to current feedback.
- [ ] Explanation of how each domain concept supports user learning goals.
- [ ] Identification of at least two unrepresented or inconsistent concepts.


---

## 🧪 Testing Plan
-Peer review
-Verify consistency between domain concepts and app features.
