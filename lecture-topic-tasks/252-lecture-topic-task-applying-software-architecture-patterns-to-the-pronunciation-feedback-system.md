## Details

## 🎯 Objective
Identify and apply relevant software architecture patterns (MVC, layered architecture, microservices) to describe the structure of the pronunciation feedback system. This connects the design phase of the project to the architectural principles discussed in the Software Design lecture.

## 📝 Description
While the documentation defines general system components, it lacks explicit references to architectural patterns that improve scalability, maintainability, and modularity.
This task will:
- Review the system's components and interactions.
- Classify the architecture using a known pattern (layered, MVC, or event driven).
- Document the reasoning for choosing that pattern and how it fits the system's goals (real time feedback, modular updates).

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Added subsection explaining the selected software architecture pattern.
- Diagram (or brief schematic) showing how components align with the pattern.
- Justification for the chosen pattern included in documentation (1 - 2 paragraphs).
