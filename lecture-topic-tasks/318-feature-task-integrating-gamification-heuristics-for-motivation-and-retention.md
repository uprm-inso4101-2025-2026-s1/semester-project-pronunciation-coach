## Details
🎯 Objective

Implement a lightweight gamification framework that improves learner motivation, consistency, and long-term retention.

⸻

📝 Description

This task aims to define and integrate core gamification heuristics such as streaks, rewards, progress bars, micro-goals, and reinforcement loops. The goal is to create research-based motivational triggers without making the app feel like a game.
The output should include a structured list of mechanics, trigger conditions, and UI components, along with a rationale for each choice and how it supports learning outcomes.

⸻

✅ Acceptance Criteria
	•	Document outlining 6–10 gamification mechanics
	•	Defined reward/feedback logic for each mechanic
	•	Wireframes or mockups for the main gamified UI elements
	•	Interaction rules explaining how users earn, lose, or maintain rewards
	•	Clear KPIs to measure success (retention, daily active users, lesson completion)

⸻

🧪 Testing Plan
	•	A/B test mockups or low-fidelity prototypes
	•	Simulate user paths to verify trigger logic
	•	Validate that gamification elements do not disrupt lesson flow
	•	Collect early feedback from 3–5 pilot users

Estimated completion time: 1–2 weeks
