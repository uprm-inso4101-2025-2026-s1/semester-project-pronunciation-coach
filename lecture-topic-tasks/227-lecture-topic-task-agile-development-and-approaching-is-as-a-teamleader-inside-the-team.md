# [Lecture Topic Task]: Agile Development and approaching is as a teamleader inside the team.

## Details
## 🎯 Objective
Enable a 3–6 person team to practice Agile inside an existing Agile system, with the team lead slicing work, assigning clear starter tasks, and helping teammates to open follow-up issues for incremental improvements.
---

## 📝 Description
We’ll establish a way for a small team to deliver within an already-running Agile program (e.g., GitHub). The team lead acts as servant-leader + splitter: translating big-picture task into bite-size tasks that are “ready to start,” then handing them out with a minimal starter scaffold. Teammates work on small parts, and when they realize they can further upgrade or optimize, they create new issues (labeled “Follow-up”) rather than expanding scope mid-sprint.

These tasks would be described / handed out / furthered talked about in team weekly meetings where the Team leader can discuss with his team about the tasks that have already been done and how to further improve them.
