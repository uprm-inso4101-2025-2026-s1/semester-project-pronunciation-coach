## Details
## 🎯 Objective
Introduce, explain, and apply the concepts of requirements satisfiability and feasibility using a checklist-based approach, showing how these ideas help evaluate the quality of the Pronunciation Coach Quiz feature requirements.

---

## 📝 Description

This lecture topic focuses on how to judge whether a set of requirements is both logically satisfiable (no internal contradictions) and practically feasible (realistic to implement under project constraints).

Using the Quiz feature as a running example, the lecture will:
- Define satisfiability and feasibility in the context of software requirements.
- Review classic requirement-quality criteria (correctness, unambiguity, completeness, consistency, verifiability, stability, traceability).
- Show how to build and use a Satisfiability & Feasibility Checklist to evaluate a small set of requirements.
- Walk through “before and after” examples where ambiguous or infeasible requirements are rewritten into clearer, testable, and more realistic versions.
- The goal is to create a short, reusable guide that classmates can consult when they review requirements in their own features.

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- Clearly define requirements satisfiability and requirements feasibility, with at least one simple example for each.
- Present and briefly explain the main requirement-quality criteria used in the checklist (e.g., correct, unambiguous, complete, consistent, verifiable, stable, traceable).
- Design a checklist template (e.g., Markdown table) that can be applied to any small requirement set.
- Apply the checklist to at least 8–10 Quiz feature requirements, showing:
- Quality criteria evaluation (check mark/x/?) and short notes.
- At least one example of an unsatisfiable requirement set (a conflict between two or more requirements).
- A feasibility classification (Feasible / Risky / Not feasible now) with a brief justification.
- Provide at least three before→after requirement rewrites that demonstrate how the checklist leads to clearer or more feasible requirements.
- Explains the concepts (satisfiability, feasibility, quality criteria),
- Includes at least one worked example from the Quiz feature.

---

## 🧪 Testing Plan

- Check that the lecture material correctly distinguishes satisfiability vs. feasibility with clear examples.
- Verify that the checklist template includes all discussed quality criteria and is understandable on its own.
- Review the filled checklist example to ensure it:
- Covers 8–10 requirements,
- Identifies at least one unsatisfiable set,
- Provides feasibility classifications with reasons.
- Confirm that the “before→after” examples show a real improvement in clarity or implementability.
- Peer-review the slide deck to ensure it aligns with Requirements Engineering lecture concepts and is understandable for classmates who did not read the underlying project docs.
