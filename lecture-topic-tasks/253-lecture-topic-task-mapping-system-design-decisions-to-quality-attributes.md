## Details

## 🎯 Objective
Connect key design decisions (use of modular components, data pipelines, or asynchronous feedback) to the software quality attributes discussed in the Software Design Principles lecture - such as maintainability, scalability, usability, and performance.

## 📝 Description
This task links architecture and design decisions to the qualities they enable, helping ensure the project's design meets its intended performance and user experience goals.
It involves:
- Identifying 3 - 5 major design choices already made.
- Mapping each to one or more quality attributes (modular design and maintainability).
- Summarizing trade offs or justifications in a short table or paragraph.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Table mapping design decisions to software quality attributes.
- Each mapping includes a short justification.
- Section added or referenced in the design documentation under "Design Rationale" or "Quality Goals."
