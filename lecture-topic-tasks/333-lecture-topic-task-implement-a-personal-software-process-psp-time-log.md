## Details
## 🎯 Objective
Track all project-related work for 3 days using the Personal Software Process (PSP) time-logging format to gather personal data for planning and analysis, as described in the TimeManagement.pdf lecture.

---

## 📝 Description
The Personal Software Process (PSP) is a method for engineers to improve their planning and quality by relying on "personally collected data". A fundamental component of this is keeping a detailed "time log on all activities". This task involves creating and maintaining this log, specifically recording fields like Date, Start, Stop, Interruption, Delta (net time), and Activity . This will provide a practical application of PSP and create a personal dataset for improving time estimates.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
List the conditions that must be met for this issue to be considered complete.  
[ ] Create a spreadsheet or document formatted according to the "Time Recording Log" template from the lecture .
[ ] Log all project-related work (programming, planning, testing, etc.) for a minimum of 3 consecutive days.
[ ] Diligently record any "Interruption" time, as specified by the PSP method.
[ ] At the end of the 3-day period, create an "Activity Summary" (like the "Weekly Activity Summary" ) that totals the net minutes spent on each activity category.
