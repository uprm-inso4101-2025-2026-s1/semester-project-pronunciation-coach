## Details
## 🎯 Objective
Create a new section to document behavioral patterns, tendencies, and attitudes of domain stakeholders that affect how the pronunciation coaching systems wil be used.
---

## 📝 Description
The “Domain Engineering and Domain Facets” lecture identifies human behavior as a key facet that shapes domain processes.
Understanding user behavior is crucial for designing an app that support real usage patterns rather than idealized ones.

Our documentation currently captures who the stakeholders are and what they need, but not how they behave when interacting with the system or domain.
This section will describe the human tendencies, habits, and behavioral risks observed or assumed within the pronunciation coaching domain.

It should include:
- Common learner behaviors (motivation loss, overconfidence, frustration)
- Behavioral risks or biases (avoidance of feedback, overreliance on automation)
- Implications of these behaviors for system design (e.g., reminders, gamification)
---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Section 2.1.8 “Human Behavior Facet Analysis” is added
- [ ] Includes behavioral observations of the stakeholders
- [ ] Identifies 2–3 behavior patterns or tendencies relevant to pronunciation learning

---

## 🧪 Testing Plan
- Verify that behaviors are realistic and based in either research, observation, or reasonable assumptions
- Check that each behavioral point connects to at least one design implication
