## Details
 🎯 Objective
Create a simple Weekly Time Budget section that applies the Time Management lecture to our Pronunciation Coach project. This section will show how we plan weekly work distribution for Milestone #3. 

📝 Description
This issue adds a short section to the documentation that defines the team’s weekly time budget for Milestone work. It includes total weekly project hours and a small table dividing time across Requirements, Coding, Documentation, Testing, and Meetings. A short note will explain how the team adjusts the budget when workload changes.

✅ Acceptance Criteria
-  A Weekly Time Budget section is added to documentation
-  Includes a table with activity categories and planned minutes
-  Includes a short explanation of how time budgets help the team
-  Clean formatting and consistent with existing documentation style


🧪 Testing Plan
- Verify that the new section accurately reflects the Time Management slides
- Ensure the table and explanation are clear and readable
- Peer review to ensure the section is understandable and matches course expectations
