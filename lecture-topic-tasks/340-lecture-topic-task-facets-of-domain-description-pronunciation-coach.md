## Details
## 🎯 Objective
Identify and document the Domain Description Facets relevant to the Pronunciation Coach system, as presented in lecture, and map each facet to concrete elements of the project.

---

## 📝 Description
This issue focuses on applying the domain analysis method discussed in class to the Pronunciation Coach project.
The following facets will be examined and documented:

Intrinsic Facet – inherent properties of speech audio, phonemes, and scoring

Support Technology Facet – microphone hardware, STT engines, ML processing

Human Behavior Facet – user pronunciation habits, repetition patterns, motivation

Business Processes Facet – structured learning workflows, quiz cycles, progress routines

Rules & Regulations Facet – privacy constraints, educational requirements, accessibility

Scripts Facet – standard behavioral patterns (listen → speak → receive feedback → retry)

Management & Organization Facet – team processes, milestone structure, classroom expectations

These will help refine domain understanding and support later requirements and design tasks.

Each facet includes a brief explanation and its application to Pronunciation Coach
