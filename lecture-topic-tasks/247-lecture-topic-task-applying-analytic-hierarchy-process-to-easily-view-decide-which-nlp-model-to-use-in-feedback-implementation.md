## Details
## 🎯 Objective

Create a simple way to view the different options we have for implementing NLP models into our feedback and make it easier to decide the best option.
---

## 📝 Description

We are currently in the process of deciding how to implement NLP models into our feedback. To be able to clearly see the benefits and problems with each one, we can rank them using the Analytic Hierarchy Process. Here we can focus on our goal, the criteria, and how each option ranks in these criteria.
---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- [ ]   A document is provided with the Analytic Hierarchy Process applied to the decision of what NLP model to implement. 
- [ ]   Information is clear and follows the Analytic Hierarchy Process.
- [ ]   Information is helpful to deciding the way/model to implement feedback in the project.
---

## 🧪 Testing Plan
-  Information will be shared with group and will ask for feedback.
-  As a group, we will review the information and decide which option to choose.
