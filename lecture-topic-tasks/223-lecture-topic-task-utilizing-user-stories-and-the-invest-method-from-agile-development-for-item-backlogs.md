## 📝 Description
In this lecture topic task, principal project featuers will be captured as user stories using the standard "As a 'role' I want to 'perform activity' in order to 'higher-level goal'" format. These sroties will then be analyzed against hte INVEST (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Testable) criteria discussed in the lecture. The goal is to create a set of well-defined, actionable items for the project backlog, directly applying the concepts fo user story creation and backlog grooming.
