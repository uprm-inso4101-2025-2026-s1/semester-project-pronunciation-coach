## Details
## 🎯 Objective

Create very detailed sequence diagrams of the homepage that was created for Pronunciation Coach as a way to show and understand the different interactions ocurring with the methods. 

---

## 📝 Description

Produce multiple sequence diagrams using PlantUML to show key interactions in the homepage, this will consist of three different sequence diagrams with different purposes:
- The first sequence diagram focuses on the entire screen HomeScreen.build(), its purpose is so we are able to understand the screen's architecture and as a way to document and explain what was created.
- The second sequence diagram is based on UserInfoBox.build(), its purpose is so we are able to analize the behavioral logic, and as a way to debug or even rebild any UI logic we analized.
- The third sequence diagram is based on WelcomeBackBox.build() and its purpose is the same as the second sequence diagram, but focusing on a different method that behaves differently from the second one.

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] A PlantUML file exists for each diagram
- [ ] Each diagram accurately reflects what was explained in the description
- [ ] Visual exports are generated for inclusion in the documentation
- [ ] Diagrams are commited to its appropriate directory

---

## 🧪 Testing Plan
- Validate that each diagram compiles correctly in a PlantUML renderer.
- Compare the diagrams against the code in the repository for the homepage to confirm accuracy.
- Include rendered diagrams in project documentation for verification.
