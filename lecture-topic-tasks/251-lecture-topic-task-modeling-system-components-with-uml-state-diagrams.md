# [Lecture Topic Task]: Modeling System Components with UML State Diagrams

## Details

## 🎯 Objective
Model the system's major interactive components (e.g., pronunciation evaluator, quiz handler, user feedback display) using UML State Diagrams, as introduced in the Modeling Software Behavior lecture.

## 📝 Description
The current documentation includes class diagrams and sequence flows but lacks behavioral modeling.
This task adds a visual representation of component states and transitions — clarifying system behavior such as "Recording → Analyzing → Feedback Displayed."
The diagram will be included as a new subsection in the documentation for future reference in design validation.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- UML State Diagram created and added under system design documentation.
- Diagram illustrates at least one interactive process (e.g., pronunciation feedback).
- Short explanation of state transitions and conditions included below diagram.
