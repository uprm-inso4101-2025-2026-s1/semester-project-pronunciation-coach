## Details
### 🎯 Objective

Document and analyze the **Maintenance Requirements (Section 2.2.9)** for the *Pronunciation Coach* system, focusing on how the app will ensure long-term reliability, adaptability, and quality improvement through defined maintenance categories (Adaptive, Corrective, Perfective, and Preventive).

---

### 📝 Description

This task involves reviewing and organizing all maintenance-related requirements that ensure the sustainability of the *Pronunciation Coach* system after deployment.
The maintenance section includes four key types:

* **Adaptive Maintenance:** Enables the app to evolve by adding new languages, supporting new OS versions, and maintaining accessibility compliance.
* **Corrective Maintenance:** Establishes a structured process for identifying, reporting, and fixing defects through crash reports, bug prioritization, and hotfix capabilities.
* **Perfective Maintenance:** Focuses on improving performance, UI/UX, gamification effectiveness, and pronunciation model accuracy based on real user analytics.
* **Preventive Maintenance:** Emphasizes proactive measures such as security scans, database migration testing, API monitoring, and code quality tracking.

Additionally, it defines a **Maintenance Process** that includes version control, documentation standards, resource allocation, and measurable success metrics (like Mean Time to Repair and Defect Recurrence Rate).
This ensures that the *Pronunciation Coach* system remains stable, scalable, and efficient as technology and user needs evolve.

---

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria

* Section **2.2.6 Maintenance Requirements** is fully developed and integrated into the documentation.
* Includes all four categories of maintenance (Adaptive, Corrective, Perfective, Preventive).
* Adds subsections for **Maintenance Process**, **Success Metrics**, and **Integration with Existing Requirements**.
* Each requirement includes clear purpose, rationale, and measurable targets.
* Aligns with software maintenance best practices and supports long-term sustainability of the app.

---

### 🧪 Testing Plan

* Review that all maintenance categories are properly defined and formatted.
* Ensure that success metrics are measurable and logically connected to project objectives.
* Verify that the section links properly to related requirements (Sections 2.2.3–2.2.5 and 3.2).
* Conduct internal peer review to confirm clarity and consistency across subsections.
