## Details
## 🎯 Objective
Document the Structure for the App's Educational Structure with Class Charts

## 📝 Description
The Pronunciation Coach App currently contextualizes the app's base features and capabilities. However, for Educational Purposes, the structure of the app doesn't determine nor contextualize the features enough. This issue could create miscommunication or different interpretations between Teams for Features the app desires. To combat that, Documentation must be done to contextualize the Pronunciation Coach App's Strategy for educating the Student. Class Charts will result in the Structure's Documentation in the most clean way possible
