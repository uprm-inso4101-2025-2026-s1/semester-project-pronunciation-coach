## Details
🎯 **Objective**
Add Section **2.2.7 Error Handling and Data Validation Requirements** to the documentation.
This section will define how the system handles invalid input, storage errors, or unexpected failures while ensuring that the user experience and progress tracking remain consistent.

---

📝 **Description**

Currently, the documentation covers the system’s main functions but lacks a clear definition of **how the system manages data errors and validation**.
This task will focus on:

* Defining validation requirements for audio input, user IDs, and challenge data.
* Specifying how the system should handle and display error messages.
* Outlining recovery behavior for failed saves or network interruptions.
* Describing internal logging and debugging standards to ensure data integrity.

Proposed Subsections:

1. **Input Validation** – ensuring data integrity before processing.
2. **Error Feedback** – providing meaningful, localized error messages.
3. **Recovery Behavior** – handling storage or network errors gracefully.
4. **Logging and Debugging** – recording errors for diagnostic purposes.

---

✅ **Acceptance Criteria**

* Section 2.2.7 is added to the documentation following existing formatting.
* Includes at least **4 core requirements**: validation, error handling, recovery, and logging.
* Uses consistent structure and writing style with Sections 2.2.3–2.2.6.
* Clearly explains how each mechanism supports system stability and user experience.

---

🧪 **Testing Plan**

* Verify that all listed error-handling requirements are clearly stated.
* Review formatting and consistency against previous sections.
* Check that terminology matches system terminology (XP, streaks, pronunciation attempts, etc.).
