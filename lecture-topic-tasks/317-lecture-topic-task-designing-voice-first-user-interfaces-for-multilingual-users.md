## Details
🎯 Objective

Define best practices and implementation guidelines for creating multilingual voice-first user interfaces that are intuitive, accurate, and accessible.

⸻

📝 Description

This task focuses on designing UX patterns and technical workflows for voice-first interactions across multiple languages. It includes considerations for accent variance, pronunciation modeling, fallback behaviors, error handling, and culturally-aware responses. The goal is to establish a standard approach that can be applied to any voice-enabled feature in the app.
Deliverables may include UI flow diagrams, supported language lists, speech recognition configurations, and proposed UX patterns.

⸻

✅ Acceptance Criteria
	•	Document describing multilingual voice-first UX guidelines
	•	Proposed flows for language detection and switching
	•	Clear patterns for errors, confirmations, and retries
	•	Recommendations for speech recognition engines per language
	•	Accessibility considerations (speed, clarity, background noise handling)

⸻

🧪 Testing Plan
	•	Test voice inputs across languages (manual recordings + synthetic tests)
	•	Validate behavior with thick accents and background noise
	•	Ensure proper fallback when recognition fails
	•	Confirm the UI behaves consistently across all languages
