## Details
## 🎯 Objective
Decompose the "AI Pronunciation Coach" project into a deliverable-oriented tree structure based on the WBS concepts from the "Scheduling and Planning" lecture.

---

## 📝 Description
This task involves applying the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) methodology from the TimeManagement.pdf lecture. A WBS is defined as a "deliverable-oriented" decomposition of a project. This task will create a visual, tree-like structure  that breaks the main project deliverable ("AI Pronunciation Coach") into smaller, manageable components. The structure will follow WBS principles such as the "100% rule" (capturing all deliverables) and focusing on "outcomes" or results rather than actions .

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
List the conditions that must be met for this issue to be considered complete.  
[ ] Create a diagram (e.g., a tree chart or nested list) representing the WBS for the AI Pronunciation Coach project.

[ ] The WBS must be deliverable-oriented, starting with the main app as the top-level node.

[ ] The decomposition must include all major features (e.g., Authentication, Chatbot, Quiz) as child components.

[ ] The final "terminal elements" (work packages) should represent measurable deliverables (e.g., "Audio Recording UI," "Quiz Scoring Screen").
