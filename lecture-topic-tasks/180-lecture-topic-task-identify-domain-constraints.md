## Details
🎯 Objective

Apply Domain Engineering principles (SE-V3:8, SE-V3:11, SE-V3:16) to identify and describe the constraints that exist within the project’s problem domain.
These constraints define what cannot happen or what must always hold true in the real world the system models.

⸻

📝 Description

This task focuses on documenting domain constraints — the fixed rules or limitations of the environment that the software must respect.

Examples of domain constraints include:
	•	Legal or policy restrictions (e.g., “user data must remain private”)
	•	Physical limitations (e.g., “a sensor can only capture up to 100 readings per second”)
	•	Logical or business rules (e.g., “an event cannot start before the organizer confirms payment”)

The goal is to create a short, clear list of 5–7 domain constraints that shape how the system operates.

Add them as a bullet list or simple table in the documentation under a new subsection:

Section 2.X.X – Domain Constraints

⸻

⚙️ Implementation Plan
	1.	Review existing domain and requirements documentation.
	2.	Identify explicit or implicit constraints that come from the problem space (not from implementation).
	3.	Write short, clear constraint statements (1 sentence each).
	4.	Commit the update to the documentation (AsciiDoc or Markdown).
	5.	Link the commit or PR to this issue for manager review.

⸻

🔬 Testing / Verification Plan
	•	Team lead verifies that all constraints logically describe real-world limitations of the domain.
	•	Manager confirms that constraints are consistent with project goals and requirements.

⸻

✅ Deliverables
	•	New section in team documentation titled “Domain Constraints”
	•	A concise list or table of 5–7 constraints clearly tied to the domain

⏰ Deadline

Within 5 days of issue creation (preferably early in the milestone).
