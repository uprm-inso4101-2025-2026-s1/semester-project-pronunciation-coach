## Details
## 🎯 Objective
Integrate the principles of Requirements Evaluation into the Pronunciation Coach documentation by showing how requirement conflicts and system risks can be identified, analyzed, and resolved systematically during the app’s planning and feature design.
---

## 📝 Description
The Requirements Evaluation lecture by Axel Van Lamsweerde emphasizes how inconsistencies, conflicts, and risks in requirements can threaten project success. Applying these ideas, this documentation will:

- Identify potential conflicts between functional and non-functional requirements (e.g., accuracy vs. responsiveness).

- Describe how risk analysis and requirements prioritization ensure a more stable design process.

- Explain how negotiation and alternative selection strategies support balanced development decisions in Pronunciation Coach.

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
