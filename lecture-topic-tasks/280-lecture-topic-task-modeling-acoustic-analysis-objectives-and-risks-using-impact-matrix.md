## Details
## 🎯 Objective
Use an Impact matrix to numerically determine the impact that certain risks will have on the objectives of the Acoustic analysis.

---

## 📝 Description
Based on the risks outlined in Issue #171 <Risk Identification & Mitigation Table Implementation for Team 2>, use the applicable risk consequences and their probability in an Impact matrix in order to numerically visualize their impact on the different objectives of the Acoustic in the form of knowing each risks criticality and how the combination of risks affects the objective. This will help determine the risks that need to be tackled the most in the development of the Acoustic Analisis code.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] List of objectives with their weights
- [ ] List of risk consequences with their likelyhoods
- [ ] Impact matrix showing how the risk consequences affect the objectives
