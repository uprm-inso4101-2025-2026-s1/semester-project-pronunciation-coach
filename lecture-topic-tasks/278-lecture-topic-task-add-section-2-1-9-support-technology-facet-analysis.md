# [Lecture Topic Task]: Add Section 2.1.9 “Support Technology Facet Analysis"

## Details
## 🎯 Objective
Create a new section to document the supporting technologies that enable our pronunciation coach system to function, including their levels, constraints, and role in implementing other facets of the domain.
---

## 📝 Description
The “Domain Engineering and Domain Facets” lecture identifies Support Technology as a key facet that deals with the technological means used to implement domain behavior.

Our documentation currently references certain tools (e.g., Whisper, Vosk, phonetic dictionaries), but does not have a structured section that describes support technologies or their quality constraints.
This section will describe the human tendencies, habits, and behavioral risks observed or assumed within the pronunciation coaching domain.

This new section should describe:
- the means of implementation 
- different technology levels
- quality constraints
- how support technology enables/carries other domain facets
---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Section 2.1.9 “Support Technology Facet Analysis” is added
- [ ] Includes description of multiple levels of technology used in the domain
- [ ] Identifies at least 3–4 quality constraints associated with support technology

---

## 🧪 Testing Plan
- Verify that the section names at least two different technology levels
- Check that all quality constraint areas from the lecture are included
- Confirm the section explains how technology enables other facets
