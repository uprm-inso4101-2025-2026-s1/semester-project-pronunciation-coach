# [Lecture Topic Task]: Evaluating Alternative Speech-to-Text Designs through Quality Attribute Analysis

## Details
## 🎯 Objective
Analyze how two different Speech to Text  design options, Whisper and Vosk, affect software quality attributes such as accuracy, performance, usability, and verifiability in the Pronunciation Coach architecture. 
---

## 📝 Description
The Pronunciation Coach system relies on STT modules to provide pronunciation feedback.
The two candidates, Whisper and Vosk, present distinct quality attribute profiles:

- Whisper - Higher accuracy, but more computationally expensive and slower.
- Vosk - Lower accuracy, but lightweight and fully offline.

The purpose of this task is as follows:

- Identify two or more quality attributes affected by the choice of STT engine (e.g., accuracy, performance, verifiability).

- Construct a comparison table summarizing how each alternative performs for each attribute.

- Create a simple architecture diagram showing the STT module within the system and where the trade-offs occur.

- Write a short discussion paragraph describing how the trade-offs relate to the system’s overall quality goals and non-functional requirements.
