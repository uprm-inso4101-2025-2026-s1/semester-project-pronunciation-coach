# [Lecture Topic Task]: Add New Section 2.1.8 for Team 3 Documentation

## Details
## 🎯 Objective
Create a new Section 2.1.8 "Domain Phenomena vs. Concepts Classification" for the documentation of team 3, following the "Phenomena and Concepts" lecture guidelines to clearly distinguish between observable instances and abstract concepts in our domain.

## 📝 Description
**Lecture Connection:** The "Phenomena and Concepts" lecture explains the distinction between phenomena (observable, concrete instances that can be sensed or measured) and concepts (abstractions, classes, types). This distinction helps our team and the teams in general to avoid confusion between actual runtime instances and the classes/types that describe them.

**Current Gap:** Our domain description sometimes mixes specific instances with general types — for example, "Language Learner" might refer to Maria (a phenomenon) or the learner category (a concept). Clarifying these distinctions will make our design and data structures more precise.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

-  [ ] New Section 2.1.8 created with clear formatting
- [ ] Simple table with minimum 6 domain elements showing phenomenon vs. concept examples
- [ ] List of 5-6 entities marked as atomic or composed
- [ ] For composed entities, list their component parts
- [ ] Written in clear, simple language without the use of any technical words.

## 🧪 Testing Plan

- Each phenomenon example should be something that could exist in a running system.
- Each concept example should represent an abstraction or type.
- Atomic/composed classifications must match expected data structure designs.
- Section should make Section 2.1.4 entities easier to interpret.
