## Details
## 🎯 Objective
To design an intuitive and engaging way to get the user's voice as training data.

---

## 📝 Description
If we want the voice cloning model to mimic the user's voice, we need a feature on the app to get the training data directly from the user. This feature should be optional, yet encouraged by the app, and should be engaging and not take too much time from the user. It should be optimized to gain enough data from the user to clone their voice perfectly, while also assuming that the user's pronunciation is not perfect. This issue is to provide a flowchart of the user experience when using the feature. Multiple methods will be suggested.
