## Details
## 🎯 Objective
Apply Design Rationale Documentation principles from Risk Analysis File [Chapter 3 (slides 43 - 45)] to record why specific interface design choices were made for the Pronunciation Feedback Display.
The goal is to strengthen the documentation process by formally linking each design decision to the underlying problem, explored alternatives, and justification.

---

## 📝 Description
This task focuses on the structure and traceability of design reasoning rather than NFR trade-offs.
Following Van Lamsweerde’s approach, the documentation will explicitly capture:

- The decision question (e.g., "How should pronunciation feedback be shown?")

- The alternatives considered (e.g., text, visual, or audio-based feedback)

- The criteria for selection (based on user context, accessibility, or learning flow)

- The final rationale explaining why the chosen design best meets project goals.

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria 
- [ ] Document at least one design decision record (DDR) entry following the rationale structure: Question → Alternatives → Criteria → Decision → Justification.
- [ ] Include at least three alternatives and specify which was selected.
- [ ] Insert the record under Section 3.3 Design Decision Rationale in the documentation.

---

## 🧪 Testing Plan
- Check that each documented decision follows the full rationale structure.
- Verify all alternatives and criteria are explicitly listed.
- Confirm the reasoning is understandable without needing additional context.
