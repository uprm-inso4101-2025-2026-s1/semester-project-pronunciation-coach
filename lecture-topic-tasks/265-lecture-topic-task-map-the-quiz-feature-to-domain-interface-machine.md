## Details
## 🎯 Objective

Classify the Quiz feature’s behaviors into Domain, Interface, and Machine by creating a mapping table of key actions such as: opening the quiz, answering a question, and viewing results, etc. Each action will be marked with D/I/M and add a short justification.
---

## 📝 Description
Topic used: Phases of Software Engineering — Triptych

- **How it’s used**: Applying the Requirements prescription facet to the Quiz: list the shared behaviors users see (Interface), tie it to real-world facts and goals (Domain), and forward to the software responsibilities that realize them (Machine). The result is a concise mapping that reduces ambiguity for design, testing, and future changes.

- **What to produce**: Mapping table with ≥12 Quiz items.

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Mapping table with ≥12 Quiz items (e.g., open quiz, load question, play prompt, capture selection, submit, evaluate, get score, etc) 
- [x] 	Each row marked D / I / M with a one-sentence justification.
- [x] Matches current app screens/buttons.
