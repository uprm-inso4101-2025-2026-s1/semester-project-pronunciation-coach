## Details
## 🎯 Objective
Create an introductory welcome screen for the Pronunciation Coach app and document a draft of the software architecture flow from app launch through main navigation thus far.

---

## 📝 Description
Lecture Connection: Applies "Phases of Software Engineering" lecture - specifically Software Architecture principles of assigning responsibilities and defining interconnections between components.

**What to Build & Document:**

**Part 1: Welcome Screen Implementation**

•	Create engaging introductory screen that welcomes users to Pronunciation Coach
•	Simple, clean design that loads before main app content
•	3-5 second duration then auto-navigates to main app

**Part 2: Architecture Documentation**

•	Document complete component flow: Introduction → Login → Main Page → Feature Widgets
•	Define component responsibilities at each stage
•	Map interconnections and data flow between screens
•	Show how requirements map to specific UI components

**Architecture Flow to Document:**

App Launch → Welcome Screen → Login/Auth → Main Dashboard → 
├── Challenge Widget
├── Progress Tracking Widget  
├── Daily Challenge Widget
└── Profile Settings Widget


---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

**For Welcome Screen:**

•	Clean, professional welcome screen with app branding
•	3-5 second auto-navigation to main app
•	Smooth loading animation
•	Mobile-responsive design

**For the Architecture Draft Documentation:**

•	Component responsibility matrix showing which components handle specific requirements
•	Navigation flow diagram with interconnection definitions
•	Data flow documentation between screens
•	State management strategy for user session across components


---

## 🧪 Testing Plan

•	Welcome screen displays correctly and navigates automatically
•	No performance issues during transition
•	Architecture documentation matches actual implementation
•	Peer review of component responsibility assignments


---

## ⏱️ Timeframe
Estimated completion time: 3 days

•	Day 1: Welcome screen implementation
•	Day 2/3: Architecture Draft documentation/ Testing and refinement
