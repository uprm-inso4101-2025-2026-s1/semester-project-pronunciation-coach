## Details
🎯 Objective
Create a Risk Identification & Mitigation Table to identify potential risks that could affect the project, describe their causes, and outline strategies to minimize their impact. This ensures the team is aware of possible setbacks and has clear action plans in place to maintain project stability.

📝 Description
Up until now, the project has progressed through its documentation and planning stages without a clear record of potential risks.
This task will establish a risk management section containing a concise table (3–5 items) listing:
- The risk (what could go wrong)
- The cause (why it might happen)
- The impact (how it affects the project)
- The mitigation strategy (how to prevent or reduce it)

✅ Acceptance Criteria
-  Risk Identification & Mitigation Table created with at least 3–5 risks
-  Each entry includes risk, cause, impact, and mitigation strategy
-  Table reviewed and approved by team members

🧪 Testing Plan
- Review the list with the team to confirm relevance and accuracy
- Check that each mitigation strategy is actionable and realistic
- Ensure the table is formatted consistently in the final document
