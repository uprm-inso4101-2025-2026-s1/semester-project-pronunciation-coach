## 📝 Description
This issue outlines the hardware, system, and processing requirements for the voice cloning functionality. These requirements ensure the system can handle model training, inference, and audio processing efficiently. Key facets include:
- Audio preprocessing (resampling, normalization, validation)
- OpenVoice API request management and error handling
- Local storage of cloned voice files and metadata
- Internal scheduling and resource limits for concurrent cloning tasks
- Logging, exception management, and audit trails
