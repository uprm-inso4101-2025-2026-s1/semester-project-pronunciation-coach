# [Lecture Topic Task]: Add New Section 3.2.1 "Validation Scenarios" for Team 4

## Details
## 🎯 Objective
Expand section 3.2 "Validation and Verification" of Team 4's documentation by adding concrete stakeholder validation scenarios, directly applying lecture concepts on validation. This issue will be referenced by the lecture material on the topic, including lecture notes and PDFs (Phases of Software Engineering) which covered verification ("are we doing it right?") and the verbal expansion on validation ("are we doing the right thing?").

---

## 📝 Description
Validation requires involvement of stakeholders and works best through inspectable scenarios rather than abstract requirements. Our documentation already contains a “Validation and Verification” section, but it currently describes these concepts in general terms. This task adds 2–3 scenario-based walkthroughs to the documentation under a new section 3.2.1 "Validation Scenarios.”

Each scenario will include:

- The goal from the stakeholder's perspective.
- Preconditions for the scenario.
- Main flow (step-by-step interaction).
- Edge cases / alternative flows.
- Observable outcomes that can be judged by non-developers.
- Clear acceptance criteria.

By expanding this section, we will align more closely with the lecture’s emphasis on validation, provide documentation that stakeholders can use to review the system, and strengthen our milestone submissions with concrete examples of how requirements are tested in practice.

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria 
- [x] New section "3.2.1 Validation Scenarios" is added in the Team 4 documentation. 
- [x] At least 2 validation scenarios are fully documented in the section 3.2.1 "Validation Scenarios.”
- [x] Scenarios clearly follow lecture material (stakeholder-focused, concrete, inspectable).
- [x] Each scenario includes goal, preconditions, flow, outcomes, and acceptance criteria.
- [x] Each scenario is phrased so a non-developer stakeholder could understand and review it without technical knowledge.
- [x] Acceptance criteria inside each scenario are measurable and objective.
---

## 🧪 Testing Plan 
- At least one teammate poses as a stakeholder and reviews each scenario for clarity.
- Confirm that verification is still covered under testing (unit tests, model checking, etc.) while validation is explicitly represented with stakeholder scenarios, as described in class.
- Ensure scenarios are understandable without developer knowledge.
- Verify scenarios are consistent with existing requirements and features.
- Check that acceptance criteria are measurable and testable.
