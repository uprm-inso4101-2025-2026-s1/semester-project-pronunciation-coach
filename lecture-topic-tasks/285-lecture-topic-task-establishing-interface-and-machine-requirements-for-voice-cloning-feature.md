## Details
## 🎯 Objective
To define, and document the interface and machine requirements for the Voice Cloning feature, which uses OpenVoice for accurately generating the user's voice.

---

## 📝 Description
The Voice Cloning feature enables users to generate a cloned voice using OpenVoice. The cloned voice is then used for playback when being corrected on their pronunciation. This issue covers two requirement scopes:

1. Interface Requirements
     - Define the shared phenomena between users, the Pronunciation Coach interface, and the OpenVoice service. 

2. Machine Requirements
     - Define the internal processing, storage, and control logic used to implement and manage the cloning process.
