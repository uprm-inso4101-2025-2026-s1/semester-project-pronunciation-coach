# [Lecture Topic Task]: Applying Phenomena and Concepts research

## Details
## 🎯 Objective
Research how phenomena and concepts apply to the Pronunciation Coach app, focusing on how observable language-learning activities (speaking, feedback, correction) can be modeled as software abstractions.

---

## 📝 Description
This research task explores how the ideas from the Phenomena and Concepts lecture slides ￼can be applied to the Pronunciation Coach app domain.

Things to investigate: 

- Phenomena are observable, real-world events — such as a learner speaking a phrase, the app recording the voice, or feedback being shown.
- Concepts are abstractions in the software — such as User, SpeechSample, Feedback, and Score.

The goal is to create a report explaining how the app’s domain (language learning and pronunciation practice) can be structured through entities, functions, and events based on these distinctions. You’ll also compare how similar ideas appear in Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and UML, where phenomena map to events/interactions and concepts map to entities and data models.

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Identify and describe at least three phenomena in the Pronunciation Coach app (e.g., speaking, listening, correction).
- [ ] Identify and describe at least three concepts (e.g., User, Recording, Feedback).
- [ ] Classify domain elements into entities, functions, and events/behaviors.
- [ ] Include a short diagram or mapping showing how real-world actions (phenomena) correspond to software components (concepts).
- [ ] Summarize how this improves the clarity of your app’s design and documentation.

---

## 🧪 Testing Plan
- Peer review the report for conceptual accuracy.
- Ensure examples are specific to the Pronunciation Coach app.
- Validate that the mapping between real-world activities and code elements is consistent.
