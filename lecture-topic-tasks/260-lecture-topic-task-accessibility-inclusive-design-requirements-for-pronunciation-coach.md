## Details
## 🎯 Objective
Define and justify a concrete set of accessibility and inclusive design requirements for the Pronunciation Coach app, based on recognized accessibility standards and mobile guidelines, so the team can better support learners with diverse abilities while aligning this work with the course topics on requirements engineering and software design.

---

## 📝 Description
This Lecture Topic Task is a research-based activity focused on treating accessibility as a first-class quality attribute for the app. The work consists of reviewing relevant accessibility resources (such as WCAG 2.2, platform-specific accessibility guidelines for iOS and Android, and reputable usability references) and identifying which principles are most applicable to Pronunciation Coach’s core flows: onboarding, recording speech, receiving feedback, viewing scores/progress, and navigating exercises. This research will produce a concise set of accessibility and inclusive design requirements tailored specifically to pronunciation feedback scenarios and anxiety-reducing language learning. They will address needs for users with visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive limitations. The outcome will be a PDF that summarizes the research sources and presents the derived requirements in a structured way.

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
	•	PDF attached in this issue’s comments containing a brief literature review of relevant accessibility standards and guidelines.
	•	At least 10–15 clear, testable accessibility requirements defined and categorized, explicitly tailored to Pronunciation Coach use cases.
	•	Requirements address multiple user needs (visual, auditory, motor, cognitive) and are specific to the pronunciation-learning context (recording, feedback, progress, etc.).
	•	A one-page Accessibility Checklist is included in the PDF for developers/testers to apply to existing and future app screens and features.

---

## 🧪 Testing Plan
	•	Review each derived requirement against the cited accessibility guidelines to ensure alignment and correctness.
	•	Perform an internal peer review with at least one teammate to confirm that the requirements are understandable, feasible, and relevant to the current Pronunciation Coach design.
