# [Lecture Topic Task]: Apply Rigorous Reasoning Concepts (TLA+)

## Details
## 🎯 Objective
Integrate the concept of Rigorous Reasoning (TLA+) into the Pronunciation Coach documentation to ensure that the app’s system behavior, user interactions, and state transitions are logically consistent and verifiable at a conceptual level — before or beyond coding implementation.

---

## 📝 Description
Lecture Connection:
The Rigorous Reasoning lecture introduced TLA+, a formal specification language for verifying that system behaviors satisfy their intended properties. TLA+ uses mathematical logic to define states, transitions, and invariants, ensuring the correctness of complex systems such as concurrent or distributed applications

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Documentation includes a short explanation of how TLA+ or rigorous reasoning concepts apply to Pronunciation Coach.
- [ ] Identified at least one invariant that must always hold true.
- [ ] Demonstrates how these models prevent logical inconsistencies in the app’s design.
---

## 🧪 Testing Plan
How will this be tested?  
- Validate that the modeled system states align with the real behavior of the Flutter app.
- Review logical consistency between “state” and “next state” in documentation.
- Peer-review to confirm that invariants (e.g., data consistency) are always preserved.
