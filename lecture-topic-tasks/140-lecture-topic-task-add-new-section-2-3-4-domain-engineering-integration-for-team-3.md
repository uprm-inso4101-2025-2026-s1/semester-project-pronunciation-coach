## Details
## 🎯 Objective
Analyze how the concepts presented in the Domain Engineering and Domain Facets lecture apply to the backend implementation of the Pronunciation Coach application and add a “Domain Engineering Integration” section to document how these concepts are reflected within the project.

---

## 📝 Description
- This  issue focuses on establishing a clear relationship between the theoretical framework of Domain Engineering and Domain Facets and the practical backend structure being developed. The presentation highlights how domain understanding should drive system design through facets. By analyzing how these principles map to the current backend implementation, we can ensure our architecture accurately represents the pronunciation learning process and supports consistent progress analytics and other necessities.
