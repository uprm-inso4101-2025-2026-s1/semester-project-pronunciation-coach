## Details
## 🎯 Objective

Create a new Section 2.1.8 "Stakeholder Perspectives Analysis" for Team 2 documentation following domain engineering principles to document how different stakeholders view the pronunciation coaching domain differently.

---

## 📝 Description

**Lecture Connection:** The "Domain Engineering and Domain Facets" lecture emphasizes that different stakeholder groups have distinct perspectives on the same domain concepts. Understanding these differences is crucial for designing systems that meet diverse user needs.

**Current Gap:** Our documentation currently treats all users as "learners" without acknowledging how perspectives might differ between:
- University students vs. working professionals
- Self learners vs. institution supported
- Technical vs. non technical users
- Different native language backgrounds

**What to Document:**
- Map how key domain concepts (pronunciation feedback, progress tracking, error detection) are perceived differently across stakeholder groups
- Identify potential conflicts or inconsistencies in stakeholder requirements
- Document how these perspective differences should influence system design decisions

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] New Section 2.1.8 created with clear stakeholder group definitions
- [ ] Analysis of at least 3 distinct stakeholder perspectives on 4 key domain concepts
- [ ] Identification of 2-3 potential requirement conflicts between stakeholder groups
- [ ] Clear recommendations for handling perspective differences in system design
- [ ] References to relevant persona data from Section 2.2.2

---

## 🧪 Testing Plan

- Verify each stakeholder perspective is grounded in actual user research or persona data
- Check that perspective differences are meaningful and impact system requirements
- Ensure conflict resolutions are practical and implementable
- Validate that analysis connects back to existing domain terminology
