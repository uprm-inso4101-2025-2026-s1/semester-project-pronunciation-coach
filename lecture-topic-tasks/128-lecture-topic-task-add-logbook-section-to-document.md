## Details
## 🎯 Objective
Add a Document Logbook appendix to the project documentation to record project meetings, decisions, and changes. This will help keep track of what has been done and give a clear picture of how the project has been moving forward and why certain decisions were made.

---

## 📝 Description
Create a new appendix section called "Document Logbook" at the end of the team documentation. This log will keep track of project updates in chronological order, including meetings, requirement changes, domain clarifications, and issue resolutions. This is meant to act as a simple record of how the project changes over time and make it easier for everyone on the team (and stakeholders) to stay on the same page.

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] New appendix section "Document Logbook" is added to the documentation.
- [ ] At least 4 meaningful entries documenting meetings, decisions, or issue resolutions are included.
- [ ] Mention the logbook section somewhere in the main documentation (like the intro or project management parts).
- [ ] Entries should be clear and easy to understand.

---

## 🧪 Testing Plan
- Check that the logbook section is in the docs and formatted properly.
- Make sure entries are useful and relevant to the project.
- Confirm the main docs reference the logbook section.
- Get feedback from a teammate or stakeholder to see if it’s helpful.
