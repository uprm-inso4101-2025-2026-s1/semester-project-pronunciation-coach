# [Lecture Topic Task]: Add New Section 2.1.7 "Phenomena and Concepts for Quiz Feature" for Team 4

## Details
## 🎯 Objective
Expand section 2.1 “Domain Description” of Team 4’s documentation by adding a new subsection 2.1.7 the models how observable instances (phenomena) and abstractions (concepts) describe the quiz’s entities, functions, and behaviors referencing the lecture material on Phenomena and Concepts (phenomena-concepts.pdf). 

---

## 📝 Description
According to the lecture material on Phenomena and Concepts (phenomena-concepts.pdf), a phenomenon is an observable, concrete instance that can be sensed or measured, while a concept is an abstraction or class that represents a set of related phenomena. This issue focuses on identifying and classifying the phenomena and concepts present in the quiz algorithm in the creation of a new subsection 2.1.7 "Phenomena and Concepts for Quiz Feature". The new subsection will identify and categorize the entities, functions, and events/behaviors that make up the quiz, describing how concrete, measurable elements (phenomena) relate to abstract structures (concepts).

The analysis will include:

- Entities: Concepts that carry data, such as Word, IPA, Syllables, OptionSet, and QuizState.
- Functions: Operations that act on those entities, such as Get_Word_IPA(word) or Generate_Evil_Words(word).
- Events and behaviors: Observable actions during quiz execution, such as WordRequested, OptionsGenerated, and OptionSelected.

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [x] New section 2.1.7 "Phenomena and Concepts for Quiz Feature" is added to Team 4's documentation.
- [x] The information is consistent with the lecture material (phenomena-concepts.pdf).
- [x] Clearly defines and differentiates phenomena and concepts in the quiz feature.
- [x] Categorizes relevant entities, functions, and events/behaviors as discussed in the lecture.
- [x] Demonstrates how identified phenomena and concepts align with the quiz’s behaviors and requirements.

---

## 🧪 Testing Plan
- Ensure all classifications correctly follow the lecture framework.
- Verify that each entity, function, and event corresponds to an existing component of the quiz.
- Confirm all phenomenon to concept mappings are clear.
- Ensure that the section logically complements the rest of the documentation.
