## Details
## 🎯 Objective

Create a concise Requirements Quality & Traceability Checklist (PDF) for the Pronunciation Coach, synthesizing best-practice guidance into a ready-to-use document that the team can apply to any future requirement.

---

## 📝 Description

Produce a 3–5 page PDF that explains what makes a good software requirement and how to verify it. Summarize key quality attributes (correct, unambiguous, complete, consistent, verifiable/testable, feasible, necessary, prioritized, and traceable). Include brief examples tailored to the Pronunciation Coach (e.g., feedback latency, offline mode, privacy constraints). Provide:
	•	A printable checklist teams can use during reviews.
	•	A mini traceability matrix example showing how a requirement links to acceptance criteria, tests, and related issues/PRs.
	•	A short “how to use” section (who uses it, when in the workflow, and how to record results).
Cite real sources (standards/texts) and the course materials you provided.

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
	•	PDF (3–5 pages) stored at docs/research/requirements-quality-checklist.pdf
	•	One-page checklist covering the core requirement quality attributes
	•	Example-filled row(s) of a simple traceability matrix relevant to this project
	•	5–8 real references (standards, books, reputable articles) with proper citations
	•	At least three example requirements from the project rewritten to meet the checklist (before/after pairs)
	•	Clear “how to apply” steps for teammates during backlog grooming/reviews

---

## 🧪 Testing Plan
	•	Peer review: two teammates apply the checklist to 3 existing or proposed requirements and record pass/fail notes.
	•	Spot-check traceability: verify each example requirement maps to at least one test case and one issue/PR reference.
	•	Formatting check: confirm PDF opens cleanly and all references render correctly.
