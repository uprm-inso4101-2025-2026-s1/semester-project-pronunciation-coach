## Details
## 🎯 Objective
Map the Pronunciation Coach system to a 4-layer software architecture (Domain, Application, Presentation, Infrastructure) and document responsibilities, boundaries, and interactions.
---

## 📝 Description
The purpose of this task is to analyze and document how the Pronunciation Coach system aligns with a layered architecture. The four layers must be clearly distinguished and correctly populated.

 Domain, Application, Presentation, Infrastructure

##✅ Acceptance Criteria

 Each layer of the architecture is defined and mapped to Pronunciation Coach features

 At least 3–5 responsibilities listed per layer
 Mapping correctly follows layered architecture principles from lecture

##🧪 Testing Plan

Peer review for layer correctness and leakage
Compare with lecture definitions to ensure alignment
Verify that domain logic is not mixed with infrastructure or UI logic
